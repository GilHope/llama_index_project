Is there not ground for suspecting\nthat all philosophers, in so far as they have been dogmatists, have failed to\nunderstand women\u2014that the terrible seriousness and clumsy importunity with\nwhich they have usually paid their addresses to Truth, have been unskilled and\nunseemly methods for winning a woman? Certainly she has never allowed herself\nto be won; and at present every kind of dogma stands with sad and discouraged\nmien\u2014IF, indeed, it stands at all! For there are scoffers who maintain that it\nhas fallen, that all dogma lies on the ground\u2014nay more, that it is at its last\ngasp. But to speak seriously, there are good grounds for hoping that all\ndogmatizing in philosophy, whatever solemn, whatever conclusive and decided\nairs it has assumed, may have been only a noble puerilism and tyronism; and\nprobably the time is at hand when it will be once and again understood WHAT\nhas actually sufficed for the basis of such imposing and absolute\nphilosophical edifices as the dogmatists have hitherto reared: perhaps some\npopular superstition of immemorial time (such as the soul-superstition, which,\nin the form of subject- and ego-superstition, has not yet ceased doing\nmischief): perhaps some play upon words, a deception on the part of grammar,\nor an audacious generalization of very restricted, very personal, very\nhuman\u2014all-too-human facts. The philosophy of the dogmatists, it is to be\nhoped, was only a promise for thousands of years afterwards, as was astrology\nin still earlier times, in the service of which probably more labour, gold,\nacuteness, and patience have been spent than on any actual science hitherto:\nwe owe to it, and to its \"super-terrestrial\" pretensions in Asia and Egypt,\nthe grand style of architecture. It seems that in order to inscribe themselves\nupon the heart of humanity with everlasting claims, all great things have\nfirst to wander about the earth as enormous and awe-inspiring caricatures:\ndogmatic philosophy has been a caricature of this kind\u2014for instance, the\nVedanta doctrine in Asia, and Platonism in Europe. Let us not be ungrateful to\nit, although it must certainly be confessed that the worst, the most tiresome,\nand the most dangerous of errors hitherto has been a dogmatist error\u2014namely,\nPlato's invention of Pure Spirit and the Good in Itself. But now when it has\nbeen surmounted, when Europe, rid of this nightmare, can again draw breath\nfreely and at least enjoy a healthier\u2014sleep, we, WHOSE DUTY IS WAKEFULNESS\nITSELF, are the heirs of all the strength which the struggle against this\nerror has fostered. It amounted to the very inversion of truth, and the denial\nof the PERSPECTIVE\u2014the fundamental condition\u2014of life, to speak of Spirit and\nthe Good as Plato spoke of them; indeed one might ask, as a physician: \"How\ndid such a malady attack that finest product of antiquity, Plato? Had the\nwicked Socrates really corrupted him? Was Socrates after all a corrupter of\nyouths, and deserved his hemlock?\" But the struggle against Plato, or\u2014to speak\nplainer, and for the \"people\"\u2014the struggle against the ecclesiastical\noppression of millenniums of Christianity (FOR CHRISTIANITY IS PLATONISM FOR\nTHE \"PEOPLE\"), produced in Europe a magnificent tension of soul, such as had\nnot existed anywhere previously; with such a tensely strained bow one can now\naim at the furthest goals.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2622, "end_char_idx": 6287, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c6c3de8f-8e9e-47af-9b04-8337ce141545": {"__data__": {"id_": "c6c3de8f-8e9e-47af-9b04-8337ce141545", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9e1d2bf9-0587-4351-bf72-11d6b69e30c3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ff3048a679e97591cced124b82896a938ca8945069b5eb3931424fb508495fe1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2d6c8d55-bc39-4c45-82e1-f1fbc107e3f6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "70088628d6d867689873f5c36d81006dad4b652aa4d822e6b889c18b521722e6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bc8c1687-7558-46e3-bcdc-d5a8ccc5cc7f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "22b7df776dccbebfeacd37a5f85a02db0762213b5b71940016ee86b1537abafe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "It amounted to the very inversion of truth, and the denial\nof the PERSPECTIVE\u2014the fundamental condition\u2014of life, to speak of Spirit and\nthe Good as Plato spoke of them; indeed one might ask, as a physician: \"How\ndid such a malady attack that finest product of antiquity, Plato?

PREJUDICES OF PHILOSOPHERS\n\n1\\. The Will to Truth, which is to tempt us to many a hazardous enterprise,\nthe famous Truthfulness of which all philosophers have hitherto spoken with\nrespect, what questions has this Will to Truth not laid before us! What\nstrange, perplexing, questionable questions! It is already a long story; yet\nit seems as if it were hardly commenced. Is it any wonder if we at last grow\ndistrustful, lose patience, and turn impatiently away? That this Sphinx\nteaches us at last to ask questions ourselves? WHO is it really that puts\nquestions to us here? WHAT really is this \"Will to Truth\" in us? In fact we\nmade a long halt at the question as to the origin of this Will\u2014until at last\nwe came to an absolute standstill before a yet more fundamental question. We\ninquired about the VALUE of this Will. Granted that we want the truth: WHY NOT\nRATHER untruth? And uncertainty? Even ignorance? The problem of the value of\ntruth presented itself before us\u2014or was it we who presented ourselves before\nthe problem? Which of us is the Oedipus here? Which the Sphinx? It would seem\nto be a rendezvous of questions and notes of interrogation. And could it be\nbelieved that it at last seems to us as if the problem had never been\npropounded before, as if we were the first to discern it, get a sight of it,\nand RISK RAISING it? For there is risk in raising it, perhaps there is no\ngreater risk.\n\n2\\. \"HOW COULD anything originate out of its opposite?

The falseness of an opinion is not for us any objection to it: it is here,\nperhaps, that our new language sounds most strangely. The question is, how far\nan opinion is life-furthering, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps\nspecies-rearing, and we are fundamentally inclined to maintain that the\nfalsest opinions (to which the synthetic judgments a priori belong), are the\nmost indispensable to us, that without a recognition of logical fictions,\nwithout a comparison of reality with the purely IMAGINED world of the absolute\nand immutable, without a constant counterfeiting of the world by means of\nnumbers, man could not live\u2014that the renunciation of false opinions would be a\nrenunciation of life, a negation of life. TO RECOGNISE UNTRUTH AS A CONDITION\nOF LIFE; that is certainly to impugn the traditional ideas of value in a\ndangerous manner, and a philosophy which ventures to do so, has thereby alone\nplaced itself beyond good and evil.\n\n5\\. That which causes philosophers to be regarded half-distrustfully and half-\nmockingly, is not the oft-repeated discovery how innocent they are\u2014how often\nand easily they make mistakes and lose their way, in short, how childish and\nchildlike they are,\u2014but that there is not enough honest dealing with them,\nwhereas they all raise a loud and virtuous outcry when the problem of\ntruthfulness is even hinted at in the remotest manner. They all pose as though\ntheir real opinions had been discovered and attained through the self-evolving\nof a cold, pure, divinely indifferent dialectic (in contrast to all sorts of\nmystics, who, fairer and foolisher, talk of \"inspiration\"), whereas, in fact,\na prejudiced proposition, idea, or \"suggestion,\" which is generally their\nheart's desire abstracted and refined, is defended by them with arguments\nsought out after the event. They are all advocates who do not wish to be\nregarded as such, generally astute defenders, also, of their prejudices, which\nthey dub \"truths,\"\u2014and VERY far from having the conscience which bravely\nadmits this to itself, very far from having the good taste of the courage\nwhich goes so far as to let this be understood, perhaps to warn friend or foe,\nor in cheerful confidence and self-ridicule. The spectacle of the Tartuffery\nof old Kant, equally stiff and decent, with which he entices us into the\ndialectic by-ways that lead (more correctly mislead) to his \"categorical\nimperative\"\u2014makes us fastidious ones smile, we who find no small amusement in\nspying out the subtle tricks of old moralists and ethical preachers. Or, still\nmore so, the hocus-pocus in mathematical form, by means of which Spinoza has,\nas it were, clad his philosophy in mail and mask\u2014in fact, the \"love of HIS\nwisdom,\" to translate the term fairly and squarely\u2014in order thereby to strike\nterror at once into the heart of the assailant who should dare to cast a\nglance on that invincible maiden, that Pallas Athene:\u2014how much of personal\ntimidity and vulnerability does this masquerade of a sickly recluse betray!\n\n6\\.

Indeed, to understand how the\nabstrusest metaphysical assertions of a philosopher have been arrived at, it\nis always well (and wise) to first ask oneself: \"What morality do they (or\ndoes he) aim at?\" Accordingly, I do not believe that an \"impulse to knowledge\"\nis the father of philosophy; but that another impulse, here as elsewhere, has\nonly made use of knowledge (and mistaken knowledge!) as an instrument. But\nwhoever considers the fundamental impulses of man with a view to determining\nhow far they may have here acted as INSPIRING GENII (or as demons and\ncobolds), will find that they have all practiced philosophy at one time or\nanother, and that each one of them would have been only too glad to look upon\nitself as the ultimate end of existence and the legitimate LORD over all the\nother impulses. For every impulse is imperious, and as SUCH, attempts to\nphilosophize. To be sure, in the case of scholars, in the case of really\nscientific men, it may be otherwise\u2014\"better,\" if you will; there there may\nreally be such a thing as an \"impulse to knowledge,\" some kind of small,\nindependent clock-work, which, when well wound up, works away industriously to\nthat end, WITHOUT the rest of the scholarly impulses taking any material part\ntherein. The actual \"interests\" of the scholar, therefore, are generally in\nquite another direction\u2014in the family, perhaps, or in money-making, or in\npolitics; it is, in fact, almost indifferent at what point of research his\nlittle machine is placed, and whether the hopeful young worker becomes a good\nphilologist, a mushroom specialist, or a chemist; he is not CHARACTERISED by\nbecoming this or that. In the philosopher, on the contrary, there is\nabsolutely nothing impersonal; and above all, his morality furnishes a decided\nand decisive testimony as to WHO HE IS,\u2014that is to say, in what order the\ndeepest impulses of his nature stand to each other.\n\n7\\. How malicious philosophers can be! I know of nothing more stinging than\nthe joke Epicurus took the liberty of making on Plato and the Platonists; he\ncalled them Dionysiokolakes. In its original sense, and on the face of it, the\nword signifies \"Flatterers of Dionysius\"\u2014consequently, tyrants' accessories\nand lick-spittles; besides this, however, it is as much as to say, \"They are\nall ACTORS, there is nothing genuine about them\" (for Dionysiokolax was a\npopular name for an actor). And the latter is really the malignant reproach\nthat Epicurus cast upon Plato: he was annoyed by the grandiose manner, the\nmise en scene style of which Plato and his scholars were masters\u2014of which\nEpicurus was not a master! He, the old school-teacher of Samos, who sat\nconcealed in his little garden at Athens, and wrote three hundred books,\nperhaps out of rage and ambitious envy of Plato, who knows! Greece took a\nhundred years to find out who the garden-god Epicurus really was. Did she ever\nfind out?\n\n8\\. There is a point in every philosophy at which the \"conviction\" of the\nphilosopher appears on the scene; or, to put it in the words of an ancient\nmystery:\n\nAdventavit asinus, Pulcher et fortissimus.\n\n9\\.

The eagerness and subtlety, I should even say craftiness, with which the\nproblem of \"the real and the apparent world\" is dealt with at present\nthroughout Europe, furnishes food for thought and attention; and he who hears\nonly a \"Will to Truth\" in the background, and nothing else, cannot certainly\nboast of the sharpest ears.

It seems to me that there is everywhere an attempt at present to divert\nattention from the actual influence which Kant exercised on German philosophy,\nand especially to ignore prudently the value which he set upon himself. Kant\nwas first and foremost proud of his Table of Categories; with it in his hand\nhe said: \"This is the most difficult thing that could ever be undertaken on\nbehalf of metaphysics.\" Let us only understand this \"could be\"! He was proud\nof having DISCOVERED a new faculty in man, the faculty of synthetic judgment a\npriori. Granting that he deceived himself in this matter; the development and\nrapid flourishing of German philosophy depended nevertheless on his pride, and\non the eager rivalry of the younger generation to discover if possible\nsomething\u2014at all events \"new faculties\"\u2014of which to be still prouder!\u2014But let\nus reflect for a moment\u2014it is high time to do so. \"How are synthetic judgments\na priori POSSIBLE?\" Kant asks himself\u2014and what is really his answer? \"BY MEANS\nOF A MEANS (faculty)\"\u2014but unfortunately not in five words, but so\ncircumstantially, imposingly, and with such display of German profundity and\nverbal flourishes, that one altogether loses sight of the comical niaiserie\nallemande involved in such an answer. People were beside themselves with\ndelight over this new faculty, and the jubilation reached its climax when Kant\nfurther discovered a moral faculty in man\u2014for at that time Germans were still\nmoral, not yet dabbling in the \"Politics of hard fact.\" Then came the\nhoneymoon of German philosophy. All the young theologians of the Tubingen\ninstitution went immediately into the groves\u2014all seeking for \"faculties.\" And\nwhat did they not find\u2014in that innocent, rich, and still youthful period of\nthe German spirit, to which Romanticism, the malicious fairy, piped and sang,\nwhen one could not yet distinguish between \"finding\" and \"inventing\"! Above\nall a faculty for the \"transcendental\"; Schelling christened it, intellectual\nintuition, and thereby gratified the most earnest longings of the naturally\npious-inclined Germans.

Enough, however\u2014the world grew older, and the dream vanished. A\ntime came when people rubbed their foreheads, and they still rub them today.\nPeople had been dreaming, and first and foremost\u2014old Kant. \"By means of a\nmeans (faculty)\"\u2014he had said, or at least meant to say. But, is that\u2014an\nanswer? An explanation? Or is it not rather merely a repetition of the\nquestion? How does opium induce sleep? \"By means of a means (faculty),\" namely\nthe virtus dormitiva, replies the doctor in Moliere,\n\nQuia est in eo virtus dormitiva,  \nCujus est natura sensus assoupire.  \n\nBut such replies belong to the realm of comedy, and it is high time to replace\nthe Kantian question, \"How are synthetic judgments a PRIORI possible?\" by\nanother question, \"Why is belief in such judgments necessary?\"\u2014in effect, it\nis high time that we should understand that such judgments must be believed to\nbe true, for the sake of the preservation of creatures like ourselves; though\nthey still might naturally be false judgments! Or, more plainly spoken, and\nroughly and readily\u2014synthetic judgments a priori should not \"be possible\" at\nall; we have no right to them; in our mouths they are nothing but false\njudgments. Only, of course, the belief in their truth is necessary, as\nplausible belief and ocular evidence belonging to the perspective view of\nlife. And finally, to call to mind the enormous influence which \"German\nphilosophy\"\u2014I hope you understand its right to inverted commas\n(goosefeet)?\u2014has exercised throughout the whole of Europe, there is no doubt\nthat a certain VIRTUS DORMITIVA had a share in it; thanks to German\nphilosophy, it was a delight to the noble idlers, the virtuous, the mystics,\nthe artiste, the three-fourths Christians, and the political obscurantists of\nall nations, to find an antidote to the still overwhelming sensualism which\noverflowed from the last century into this, in short\u2014\"sensus assoupire.\"...\n\n12\\. As regards materialistic atomism, it is one of the best-refuted theories\nthat have been advanced, and in Europe there is now perhaps no one in the\nlearned world so unscholarly as to attach serious signification to it, except\nfor convenient everyday use (as an abbreviation of the means of\nexpression)\u2014thanks chiefly to the Pole Boscovich: he and the Pole Copernicus\nhave hitherto been the greatest and most successful opponents of ocular\nevidence. For while Copernicus has persuaded us to believe, contrary to all\nthe senses, that the earth does NOT stand fast, Boscovich has taught us to\nabjure the belief in the last thing that \"stood fast\" of the earth\u2014the belief\nin \"substance,\" in \"matter,\" in the earth-residuum, and particle-atom: it is\nthe greatest triumph over the senses that has hitherto been gained on earth.\nOne must, however, go still further, and also declare war, relentless war to\nthe knife, against the \"atomistic requirements\" which still lead a dangerous\nafter-life in places where no one suspects them, like the more celebrated\n\"metaphysical requirements\": one must also above all give the finishing stroke\nto that other and more portentous atomism which Christianity has taught best\nand longest, the SOUL-ATOMISM.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 25261, "end_char_idx": 29252, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fdf3c985-2ce9-4946-89ff-92f28c329bfa": {"__data__": {"id_": "fdf3c985-2ce9-4946-89ff-92f28c329bfa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9e1d2bf9-0587-4351-bf72-11d6b69e30c3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ff3048a679e97591cced124b82896a938ca8945069b5eb3931424fb508495fe1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9aab3ea6-ebb3-4c56-a414-17d6a6053d7a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "bec833866c29efc6d36a7d574fe421b091b802ef7a2ded89f380c527a71973f1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bd7f80f8-4fc5-4142-ab48-e6044487aa23", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "df97cb946a85d92ae51a05a20172991fcfb178503cfe29fd51aca7ac391fd2f8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "For while Copernicus has persuaded us to believe, contrary to all\nthe senses, that the earth does NOT stand fast, Boscovich has taught us to\nabjure the belief in the last thing that \"stood fast\" of the earth\u2014the belief\nin \"substance,\" in \"matter,\" in the earth-residuum, and particle-atom: it is\nthe greatest triumph over the senses that has hitherto been gained on earth.\nOne must, however, go still further, and also declare war, relentless war to\nthe knife, against the \"atomistic requirements\" which still lead a dangerous\nafter-life in places where no one suspects them, like the more celebrated\n\"metaphysical requirements\": one must also above all give the finishing stroke\nto that other and more portentous atomism which Christianity has taught best\nand longest, the SOUL-ATOMISM. Let it be permitted to designate by this\nexpression the belief which regards the soul as something indestructible,\neternal, indivisible, as a monad, as an atomon: this belief ought to be\nexpelled from science! Between ourselves, it is not at all necessary to get\nrid of \"the soul\" thereby, and thus renounce one of the oldest and most\nvenerated hypotheses\u2014as happens frequently to the clumsiness of naturalists,\nwho can hardly touch on the soul without immediately losing it. But the way is\nopen for new acceptations and refinements of the soul-hypothesis; and such\nconceptions as \"mortal soul,\" and \"soul of subjective multiplicity,\" and \"soul\nas social structure of the instincts and passions,\" want henceforth to have\nlegitimate rights in science. In that the NEW psychologist is about to put an\nend to the superstitions which have hitherto flourished with almost tropical\nluxuriance around the idea of the soul, he is really, as it were, thrusting\nhimself into a new desert and a new distrust\u2014it is possible that the older\npsychologists had a merrier and more comfortable time of it; eventually,\nhowever, he finds that precisely thereby he is also condemned to INVENT\u2014and,\nwho knows? perhaps to DISCOVER the new.\n\n13\\. Psychologists should bethink themselves before putting down the instinct\nof self-preservation as the cardinal instinct of an organic being. A living\nthing seeks above all to DISCHARGE its strength\u2014life itself is WILL TO POWER;\nself-preservation is only one of the indirect and most frequent RESULTS\nthereof. In short, here, as everywhere else, let us beware of SUPERFLUOUS\nteleological principles!\u2014one of which is the instinct of self-preservation (we\nowe it to Spinoza's inconsistency). It is thus, in effect, that method\nordains, which must be essentially economy of principles.\n\n14\\. It is perhaps just dawning on five or six minds that natural philosophy\nis only a world-exposition and world-arrangement (according to us, if I may\nsay so!) and NOT a world-explanation; but in so far as it is based on belief\nin the senses, it is regarded as more, and for a long time to come must be\nregarded as more\u2014namely, as an explanation. It has eyes and fingers of its\nown, it has ocular evidence and palpableness of its own: this operates\nfascinatingly, persuasively, and CONVINCINGLY upon an age with fundamentally\nplebeian tastes\u2014in fact, it follows instinctively the canon of truth of\neternal popular sensualism. What is clear, what is \"explained\"? Only that\nwhich can be seen and felt\u2014one must pursue every problem thus far. Obversely,\nhowever, the charm of the Platonic mode of thought, which was an ARISTOCRATIC\nmode, consisted precisely in RESISTANCE to obvious sense-evidence\u2014perhaps\namong men who enjoyed even stronger and more fastidious senses than our\ncontemporaries, but who knew how to find a higher triumph in remaining masters\nof them: and this by means of pale, cold, grey conceptional networks which\nthey threw over the motley whirl of the senses\u2014the mob of the senses, as Plato\nsaid.

To study physiology with a clear conscience, one must insist on the fact\nthat the sense-organs are not phenomena in the sense of the idealistic\nphilosophy; as such they certainly could not be causes!

Consequently, the external world is NOT the\nwork of our organs\u2014?\n\n16\\. There are still harmless self-observers who believe that there are\n\"immediate certainties\"; for instance, \"I think,\" or as the superstition of\nSchopenhauer puts it, \"I will\"; as though cognition here got hold of its\nobject purely and simply as \"the thing in itself,\" without any falsification\ntaking place either on the part of the subject or the object. I would repeat\nit, however, a hundred times, that \"immediate certainty,\" as well as \"absolute\nknowledge\" and the \"thing in itself,\" involve a CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO; we\nreally ought to free ourselves from the misleading significance of words! The\npeople on their part may think that cognition is knowing all about things, but\nthe philosopher must say to himself: \"When I analyze the process that is\nexpressed in the sentence, 'I think,' I find a whole series of daring\nassertions, the argumentative proof of which would be difficult, perhaps\nimpossible: for instance, that it is _I_ who think, that there must\nnecessarily be something that thinks, that thinking is an activity and\noperation on the part of a being who is thought of as a cause, that there is\nan 'ego,' and finally, that it is already determined what is to be designated\nby thinking\u2014that I KNOW what thinking is. For if I had not already decided\nwithin myself what it is, by what standard could I determine whether that\nwhich is just happening is not perhaps 'willing' or 'feeling'? In short, the\nassertion 'I think,' assumes that I COMPARE my state at the present moment\nwith other states of myself which I know, in order to determine what it is; on\naccount of this retrospective connection with further 'knowledge,' it has, at\nany rate, no immediate certainty for me.\"\u2014In place of the \"immediate\ncertainty\" in which the people may believe in the special case, the\nphilosopher thus finds a series of metaphysical questions presented to him,\nveritable conscience questions of the intellect, to wit: \"Whence did I get the\nnotion of 'thinking'?

With regard to the superstitions of logicians, I shall never tire of\nemphasizing a small, terse fact, which is unwillingly recognized by these\ncredulous minds\u2014namely, that a thought comes when \"it\" wishes, and not when\n\"I\" wish; so that it is a PERVERSION of the facts of the case to say that the\nsubject \"I\" is the condition of the predicate \"think.\" ONE thinks; but that\nthis \"one\" is precisely the famous old \"ego,\" is, to put it mildly, only a\nsupposition, an assertion, and assuredly not an \"immediate certainty.\" After\nall, one has even gone too far with this \"one thinks\"\u2014even the \"one\" contains\nan INTERPRETATION of the process, and does not belong to the process itself.\nOne infers here according to the usual grammatical formula\u2014\"To think is an\nactivity; every activity requires an agency that is active; consequently\"...\nIt was pretty much on the same lines that the older atomism sought, besides\nthe operating \"power,\" the material particle wherein it resides and out of\nwhich it operates\u2014the atom. More rigorous minds, however, learnt at last to\nget along without this \"earth-residuum,\" and perhaps some day we shall\naccustom ourselves, even from the logician's point of view, to get along\nwithout the little \"one\" (to which the worthy old \"ego\" has refined itself).\n\n18\\. It is certainly not the least charm of a theory that it is refutable; it\nis precisely thereby that it attracts the more subtle minds. It seems that the\nhundred-times-refuted theory of the \"free will\" owes its persistence to this\ncharm alone; some one is always appearing who feels himself strong enough to\nrefute it.\n\n19\\. Philosophers are accustomed to speak of the will as though it were the\nbest-known thing in the world; indeed, Schopenhauer has given us to understand\nthat the will alone is really known to us, absolutely and completely known,\nwithout deduction or addition. But it again and again seems to me that in this\ncase Schopenhauer also only did what philosophers are in the habit of doing\u2014he\nseems to have adopted a POPULAR PREJUDICE and exaggerated it. Willing seems to\nme to be above all something COMPLICATED, something that is a unity only in\nname\u2014and it is precisely in a name that popular prejudice lurks, which has got\nthe mastery over the inadequate precautions of philosophers in all ages. So\nlet us for once be more cautious, let us be \"unphilosophical\": let us say that\nin all willing there is firstly a plurality of sensations, namely, the\nsensation of the condition \"AWAY FROM WHICH we go,\" the sensation of the\ncondition \"TOWARDS WHICH we go,\" the sensation of this \"FROM\" and \"TOWARDS\"\nitself, and then besides, an accompanying muscular sensation, which, even\nwithout our putting in motion \"arms and legs,\" commences its action by force\nof habit, directly we \"will\" anything.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 35065, "end_char_idx": 39009, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "62363d73-7015-429e-a44f-a4c6a6d54be2": {"__data__": {"id_": "62363d73-7015-429e-a44f-a4c6a6d54be2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9e1d2bf9-0587-4351-bf72-11d6b69e30c3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ff3048a679e97591cced124b82896a938ca8945069b5eb3931424fb508495fe1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "45d0e416-0b84-4301-84ff-f23dee3749a0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "c4a058186c57327d03393fef3bd8ae73b83f7a74a348ad41a00c855d46bf9157", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "29070f7b-04e9-42b9-8540-ab627c0430ce", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "00185b23ec734a9aaaa9c6fe5e8e37711a396ec48f60f192a6a15d4a49442e01", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Willing seems to\nme to be above all something COMPLICATED, something that is a unity only in\nname\u2014and it is precisely in a name that popular prejudice lurks, which has got\nthe mastery over the inadequate precautions of philosophers in all ages.

Therefore, just as sensations (and\nindeed many kinds of sensations) are to be recognized as ingredients of the\nwill, so, in the second place, thinking is also to be recognized; in every act\nof the will there is a ruling thought;\u2014and let us not imagine it possible to\nsever this thought from the \"willing,\" as if the will would then remain over!\nIn the third place, the will is not only a complex of sensation and thinking,\nbut it is above all an EMOTION, and in fact the emotion of the command. That\nwhich is termed \"freedom of the will\" is essentially the emotion of supremacy\nin respect to him who must obey: \"I am free, 'he' must obey\"\u2014this\nconsciousness is inherent in every will; and equally so the straining of the\nattention, the straight look which fixes itself exclusively on one thing, the\nunconditional judgment that \"this and nothing else is necessary now,\" the\ninward certainty that obedience will be rendered\u2014and whatever else pertains to\nthe position of the commander. A man who WILLS commands something within\nhimself which renders obedience, or which he believes renders obedience. But\nnow let us notice what is the strangest thing about the will,\u2014this affair so\nextremely complex, for which the people have only one name. Inasmuch as in the\ngiven circumstances we are at the same time the commanding AND the obeying\nparties, and as the obeying party we know the sensations of constraint,\nimpulsion, pressure, resistance, and motion, which usually commence\nimmediately after the act of will; inasmuch as, on the other hand, we are\naccustomed to disregard this duality, and to deceive ourselves about it by\nmeans of the synthetic term \"I\": a whole series of erroneous conclusions, and\nconsequently of false judgments about the will itself, has become attached to\nthe act of willing\u2014to such a degree that he who wills believes firmly that\nwilling SUFFICES for action. Since in the majority of cases there has only\nbeen exercise of will when the effect of the command\u2014consequently obedience,\nand therefore action\u2014was to be EXPECTED, the APPEARANCE has translated itself\ninto the sentiment, as if there were a NECESSITY OF EFFECT; in a word, he who\nwills believes with a fair amount of certainty that will and action are\nsomehow one; he ascribes the success, the carrying out of the willing, to the\nwill itself, and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensation of power which\naccompanies all success. \"Freedom of Will\"\u2014that is the expression for the\ncomplex state of delight of the person exercising volition, who commands and\nat the same time identifies himself with the executor of the order\u2014who, as\nsuch, enjoys also the triumph over obstacles, but thinks within himself that\nit was really his own will that overcame them. In this way the person\nexercising volition adds the feelings of delight of his successful executive\ninstruments, the useful \"underwills\" or under-souls\u2014indeed, our body is but a\nsocial structure composed of many souls\u2014to his feelings of delight as\ncommander.

That the separate philosophical ideas are not anything optional or\nautonomously evolving, but grow up in connection and relationship with each\nother, that, however suddenly and arbitrarily they seem to appear in the\nhistory of thought, they nevertheless belong just as much to a system as the\ncollective members of the fauna of a Continent\u2014is betrayed in the end by the\ncircumstance: how unfailingly the most diverse philosophers always fill in\nagain a definite fundamental scheme of POSSIBLE philosophies. Under an\ninvisible spell, they always revolve once more in the same orbit, however\nindependent of each other they may feel themselves with their critical or\nsystematic wills, something within them leads them, something impels them in\ndefinite order the one after the other\u2014to wit, the innate methodology and\nrelationship of their ideas. Their thinking is, in fact, far less a discovery\nthan a re-recognizing, a remembering, a return and a home-coming to a far-off,\nancient common-household of the soul, out of which those ideas formerly grew:\nphilosophizing is so far a kind of atavism of the highest order. The wonderful\nfamily resemblance of all Indian, Greek, and German philosophizing is easily\nenough explained. In fact, where there is affinity of language, owing to the\ncommon philosophy of grammar\u2014I mean owing to the unconscious domination and\nguidance of similar grammatical functions\u2014it cannot but be that everything is\nprepared at the outset for a similar development and succession of\nphilosophical systems, just as the way seems barred against certain other\npossibilities of world-interpretation. It is highly probable that philosophers\nwithin the domain of the Ural-Altaic languages (where the conception of the\nsubject is least developed) look otherwise \"into the world,\" and will be found\non paths of thought different from those of the Indo-Germans and Mussulmans,\nthe spell of certain grammatical functions is ultimately also the spell of\nPHYSIOLOGICAL valuations and racial conditions.\u2014So much by way of rejecting\nLocke's superficiality with regard to the origin of ideas.\n\n21\\. The CAUSA SUI is the best self-contradiction that has yet been conceived,\nit is a sort of logical violation and unnaturalness; but the extravagant pride\nof man has managed to entangle itself profoundly and frightfully with this\nvery folly. The desire for \"freedom of will\" in the superlative, metaphysical\nsense, such as still holds sway, unfortunately, in the minds of the half-\neducated, the desire to bear the entire and ultimate responsibility for one's\nactions oneself, and to absolve God, the world, ancestors, chance, and society\ntherefrom, involves nothing less than to be precisely this CAUSA SUI, and,\nwith more than Munchausen daring, to pull oneself up into existence by the\nhair, out of the slough of nothingness. If any one should find out in this\nmanner the crass stupidity of the celebrated conception of \"free will\" and put\nit out of his head altogether, I beg of him to carry his \"enlightenment\" a\nstep further, and also put out of his head the contrary of this monstrous\nconception of \"free will\": I mean \"non-free will,\" which is tantamount to a\nmisuse of cause and effect.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 41747, "end_char_idx": 45773, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fb56979a-b062-401d-b588-238229302072": {"__data__": {"id_": "fb56979a-b062-401d-b588-238229302072", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9e1d2bf9-0587-4351-bf72-11d6b69e30c3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ff3048a679e97591cced124b82896a938ca8945069b5eb3931424fb508495fe1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "29070f7b-04e9-42b9-8540-ab627c0430ce", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "80f08263bb2cd00bd5473a2a156ebdf73713f110aafbe3d6daf04616612dc1e5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f6d95b91-851b-49f7-a574-dc7765f06e26", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ea2a40fc33972d3e8e727f867b5ee8986a966068615c0e81c1bc480fde5800a7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "If any one should find out in this\nmanner the crass stupidity of the celebrated conception of \"free will\" and put\nit out of his head altogether, I beg of him to carry his \"enlightenment\" a\nstep further, and also put out of his head the contrary of this monstrous\nconception of \"free will\": I mean \"non-free will,\" which is tantamount to a\nmisuse of cause and effect.

And as a matter of fact, the fatalism of\nthe weak-willed embellishes itself surprisingly when it can pose as \"la\nreligion de la souffrance humaine\"; that is ITS \"good taste.\"\n\n22\\.

All psychology hitherto has run aground on moral prejudices and\ntimidities, it has not dared to launch out into the depths. In so far as it is\nallowable to recognize in that which has hitherto been written, evidence of\nthat which has hitherto been kept silent, it seems as if nobody had yet\nharboured the notion of psychology as the Morphology and DEVELOPMENT-DOCTRINE\nOF THE WILL TO POWER, as I conceive of it. The power of moral prejudices has\npenetrated deeply into the most intellectual world, the world apparently most\nindifferent and unprejudiced, and has obviously operated in an injurious,\nobstructive, blinding, and distorting manner. A proper physio-psychology has\nto contend with unconscious antagonism in the heart of the investigator, it\nhas \"the heart\" against it even a doctrine of the reciprocal conditionalness\nof the \"good\" and the \"bad\" impulses, causes (as refined immorality) distress\nand aversion in a still strong and manly conscience\u2014still more so, a doctrine\nof the derivation of all good impulses from bad ones. If, however, a person\nshould regard even the emotions of hatred, envy, covetousness, and\nimperiousness as life-conditioning emotions, as factors which must be present,\nfundamentally and essentially, in the general economy of life (which must,\ntherefore, be further developed if life is to be further developed), he will\nsuffer from such a view of things as from sea-sickness. And yet this\nhypothesis is far from being the strangest and most painful in this immense\nand almost new domain of dangerous knowledge, and there are in fact a hundred\ngood reasons why every one should keep away from it who CAN do so! On the\nother hand, if one has once drifted hither with one's bark, well! very good!\nnow let us set our teeth firmly! let us open our eyes and keep our hand fast\non the helm! We sail away right OVER morality, we crush out, we destroy\nperhaps the remains of our own morality by daring to make our voyage\nthither\u2014but what do WE matter. Never yet did a PROFOUNDER world of insight\nreveal itself to daring travelers and adventurers, and the psychologist who\nthus \"makes a sacrifice\"\u2014it is not the sacrifizio dell' intelletto, on the\ncontrary!\u2014will at least be entitled to demand in return that psychology shall\nonce more be recognized as the queen of the sciences, for whose service and\nequipment the other sciences exist.

In what strange simplification and falsification\nman lives! One can never cease wondering when once one has got eyes for\nbeholding this marvel! How we have made everything around us clear and free\nand easy and simple! how we have been able to give our senses a passport to\neverything superficial, our thoughts a godlike desire for wanton pranks and\nwrong inferences!\u2014how from the beginning, we have contrived to retain our\nignorance in order to enjoy an almost inconceivable freedom, thoughtlessness,\nimprudence, heartiness, and gaiety\u2014in order to enjoy life! And only on this\nsolidified, granite-like foundation of ignorance could knowledge rear itself\nhitherto, the will to knowledge on the foundation of a far more powerful will,\nthe will to ignorance, to the uncertain, to the untrue! Not as its opposite,\nbut\u2014as its refinement! It is to be hoped, indeed, that LANGUAGE, here as\nelsewhere, will not get over its awkwardness, and that it will continue to\ntalk of opposites where there are only degrees and many refinements of\ngradation; it is equally to be hoped that the incarnated Tartuffery of morals,\nwhich now belongs to our unconquerable \"flesh and blood,\" will turn the words\nround in the mouths of us discerning ones. Here and there we understand it,\nand laugh at the way in which precisely the best knowledge seeks most to\nretain us in this SIMPLIFIED, thoroughly artificial, suitably imagined, and\nsuitably falsified world: at the way in which, whether it will or not, it\nloves error, because, as living itself, it loves life!\n\n25\\. After such a cheerful commencement, a serious word would fain be heard;\nit appeals to the most serious minds. Take care, ye philosophers and friends\nof knowledge, and beware of martyrdom! Of suffering \"for the truth's sake\"!\neven in your own defense! It spoils all the innocence and fine neutrality of\nyour conscience; it makes you headstrong against objections and red rags; it\nstupefies, animalizes, and brutalizes, when in the struggle with danger,\nslander, suspicion, expulsion, and even worse consequences of enmity, ye have\nat last to play your last card as protectors of truth upon earth\u2014as though\n\"the Truth\" were such an innocent and incompetent creature as to require\nprotectors! and you of all people, ye knights of the sorrowful countenance,\nMessrs Loafers and Cobweb-spinners of the spirit! Finally, ye know\nsufficiently well that it cannot be of any consequence if YE just carry your\npoint; ye know that hitherto no philosopher has carried his point, and that\nthere might be a more laudable truthfulness in every little interrogative mark\nwhich you place after your special words and favourite doctrines (and\noccasionally after yourselves) than in all the solemn pantomime and trumping\ngames before accusers and law-courts! Rather go out of the way! Flee into\nconcealment! And have your masks and your ruses, that ye may be mistaken for\nwhat you are, or somewhat feared! And pray, don't forget the garden, the\ngarden with golden trellis-work! And have people around you who are as a\ngarden\u2014or as music on the waters at eventide, when already the day becomes a\nmemory.

The martyrdom of the philosopher, his\n\"sacrifice for the sake of truth,\" forces into the light whatever of the\nagitator and actor lurks in him; and if one has hitherto contemplated him only\nwith artistic curiosity, with regard to many a philosopher it is easy to\nunderstand the dangerous desire to see him also in his deterioration\n(deteriorated into a \"martyr,\" into a stage-and-tribune-bawler). Only, that it\nis necessary with such a desire to be clear WHAT spectacle one will see in any\ncase\u2014merely a satyric play, merely an epilogue farce, merely the continued\nproof that the long, real tragedy IS AT AN END, supposing that every\nphilosophy has been a long tragedy in its origin.\n\n26\\. Every select man strives instinctively for a citadel and a privacy, where\nhe is FREE from the crowd, the many, the majority\u2014where he may forget \"men who\nare the rule,\" as their exception;\u2014exclusive only of the case in which he is\npushed straight to such men by a still stronger instinct, as a discerner in\nthe great and exceptional sense. Whoever, in intercourse with men, does not\noccasionally glisten in all the green and grey colours of distress, owing to\ndisgust, satiety, sympathy, gloominess, and solitariness, is assuredly not a\nman of elevated tastes; supposing, however, that he does not voluntarily take\nall this burden and disgust upon himself, that he persistently avoids it, and\nremains, as I said, quietly and proudly hidden in his citadel, one thing is\nthen certain: he was not made, he was not predestined for knowledge. For as\nsuch, he would one day have to say to himself: \"The devil take my good taste!\nbut 'the rule' is more interesting than the exception\u2014than myself, the\nexception!\" And he would go DOWN, and above all, he would go \"inside.\" The\nlong and serious study of the AVERAGE man\u2014and consequently much disguise,\nself-overcoming, familiarity, and bad intercourse (all intercourse is bad\nintercourse except with one's equals):\u2014that constitutes a necessary part of\nthe life-history of every philosopher; perhaps the most disagreeable, odious,\nand disappointing part.

Lessing is an\nexception, owing to his histrionic nature, which understood much, and was\nversed in many things; he who was not the translator of Bayle to no purpose,\nwho took refuge willingly in the shadow of Diderot and Voltaire, and still\nmore willingly among the Roman comedy-writers\u2014Lessing loved also free-\nspiritism in the TEMPO, and flight out of Germany. But how could the German\nlanguage, even in the prose of Lessing, imitate the TEMPO of Machiavelli, who\nin his \"Principe\" makes us breathe the dry, fine air of Florence, and cannot\nhelp presenting the most serious events in a boisterous allegrissimo, perhaps\nnot without a malicious artistic sense of the contrast he ventures to\npresent\u2014long, heavy, difficult, dangerous thoughts, and a TEMPO of the gallop,\nand of the best, wantonest humour? Finally, who would venture on a German\ntranslation of Petronius, who, more than any great musician hitherto, was a\nmaster of PRESTO in invention, ideas, and words? What matter in the end about\nthe swamps of the sick, evil world, or of the \"ancient world,\" when like him,\none has the feet of a wind, the rush, the breath, the emancipating scorn of a\nwind, which makes everything healthy, by making everything RUN! And with\nregard to Aristophanes\u2014that transfiguring, complementary genius, for whose\nsake one PARDONS all Hellenism for having existed, provided one has understood\nin its full profundity ALL that there requires pardon and transfiguration;\nthere is nothing that has caused me to meditate more on PLATO'S secrecy and\nsphinx-like nature, than the happily preserved petit fait that under the\npillow of his death-bed there was found no \"Bible,\" nor anything Egyptian,\nPythagorean, or Platonic\u2014but a book of Aristophanes.

In the former\ncase they are dangerous, disturbing, unsettling books, in the latter case they\nare herald-calls which summon the bravest to THEIR bravery.

Throughout the longest period of human history\u2014one calls it the\nprehistoric period\u2014the value or non-value of an action was inferred from its\nCONSEQUENCES; the action in itself was not taken into consideration, any more\nthan its origin; but pretty much as in China at present, where the distinction\nor disgrace of a child redounds to its parents, the retro-operating power of\nsuccess or failure was what induced men to think well or ill of an action. Let\nus call this period the PRE-MORAL period of mankind; the imperative, \"Know\nthyself!\" was then still unknown.\u2014In the last ten thousand years, on the other\nhand, on certain large portions of the earth, one has gradually got so far,\nthat one no longer lets the consequences of an action, but its origin, decide\nwith regard to its worth: a great achievement as a whole, an important\nrefinement of vision and of criterion, the unconscious effect of the supremacy\nof aristocratic values and of the belief in \"origin,\" the mark of a period\nwhich may be designated in the narrower sense as the MORAL one: the first\nattempt at self-knowledge is thereby made. Instead of the consequences, the\norigin\u2014what an inversion of perspective! And assuredly an inversion effected\nonly after long struggle and wavering! To be sure, an ominous new\nsuperstition, a peculiar narrowness of interpretation, attained supremacy\nprecisely thereby: the origin of an action was interpreted in the most\ndefinite sense possible, as origin out of an INTENTION; people were agreed in\nthe belief that the value of an action lay in the value of its intention. The\nintention as the sole origin and antecedent history of an action: under the\ninfluence of this prejudice moral praise and blame have been bestowed, and men\nhave judged and even philosophized almost up to the present day.\u2014Is it not\npossible, however, that the necessity may now have arisen of again making up\nour minds with regard to the reversing and fundamental shifting of values,\nowing to a new self-consciousness and acuteness in man\u2014is it not possible that\nwe may be standing on the threshold of a period which to begin with, would be\ndistinguished negatively as ULTRA-MORAL: nowadays when, at least among us\nimmoralists, the suspicion arises that the decisive value of an action lies\nprecisely in that which is NOT INTENTIONAL, and that all its intentionalness,\nall that is seen, sensible, or \"sensed\" in it, belongs to its surface or\nskin\u2014which, like every skin, betrays something, but CONCEALS still more? In\nshort, we believe that the intention is only a sign or symptom, which first\nrequires an explanation\u2014a sign, moreover, which has too many interpretations,\nand consequently hardly any meaning in itself alone: that morality, in the\nsense in which it has been understood hitherto, as intention-morality, has\nbeen a prejudice, perhaps a prematureness or preliminariness, probably\nsomething of the same rank as astrology and alchemy, but in any case something\nwhich must be surmounted. The surmounting of morality, in a certain sense even\nthe self-mounting of morality\u2014let that be the name for the long-secret labour\nwhich has been reserved for the most refined, the most upright, and also the\nmost wicked consciences of today, as the living touchstones of the soul.\n\n33\\.

At whatever standpoint of philosophy one may place oneself nowadays, seen\nfrom every position, the ERRONEOUSNESS of the world in which we think we live\nis the surest and most certain thing our eyes can light upon: we find proof\nafter proof thereof, which would fain allure us into surmises concerning a\ndeceptive principle in the \"nature of things.\" He, however, who makes thinking\nitself, and consequently \"the spirit,\" responsible for the falseness of the\nworld\u2014an honourable exit, which every conscious or unconscious advocatus dei\navails himself of\u2014he who regards this world, including space, time, form, and\nmovement, as falsely DEDUCED, would have at least good reason in the end to\nbecome distrustful also of all thinking; has it not hitherto been playing upon\nus the worst of scurvy tricks? and what guarantee would it give that it would\nnot continue to do what it has always been doing? In all seriousness, the\ninnocence of thinkers has something touching and respect-inspiring in it,\nwhich even nowadays permits them to wait upon consciousness with the request\nthat it will give them HONEST answers: for example, whether it be \"real\" or\nnot, and why it keeps the outer world so resolutely at a distance, and other\nquestions of the same description. The belief in \"immediate certainties\" is a\nMORAL NAIVETE which does honour to us philosophers; but\u2014we have now to cease\nbeing \"MERELY moral\" men! Apart from morality, such belief is a folly which\ndoes little honour to us! If in middle-class life an ever-ready distrust is\nregarded as the sign of a \"bad character,\" and consequently as an imprudence,\nhere among us, beyond the middle-class world and its Yeas and Nays, what\nshould prevent our being imprudent and saying: the philosopher has at length a\nRIGHT to \"bad character,\" as the being who has hitherto been most befooled on\nearth\u2014he is now under OBLIGATION to distrustfulness, to the wickedest\nsquinting out of every abyss of suspicion.\u2014Forgive me the joke of this gloomy\ngrimace and turn of expression; for I myself have long ago learned to think\nand estimate differently with regard to deceiving and being deceived, and I\nkeep at least a couple of pokes in the ribs ready for the blind rage with\nwhich philosophers struggle against being deceived. Why NOT? It is nothing\nmore than a moral prejudice that truth is worth more than semblance; it is, in\nfact, the worst proved supposition in the world. So much must be conceded:\nthere could have been no life at all except upon the basis of perspective\nestimates and semblances; and if, with the virtuous enthusiasm and stupidity\nof many philosophers, one wished to do away altogether with the \"seeming\nworld\"\u2014well, granted that YOU could do that,\u2014at least nothing of your \"truth\"\nwould thereby remain! Indeed, what is it that forces us in general to the\nsupposition that there is an essential opposition of \"true\" and \"false\"? Is it\nnot enough to suppose degrees of seemingness, and as it were lighter and\ndarker shades and tones of semblance\u2014different valeurs, as the painters say?\nWhy might not the world WHICH CONCERNS US\u2014be a fiction?

Not to\nassume several kinds of causality, so long as the attempt to get along with a\nsingle one has not been pushed to its furthest extent (to absurdity, if I may\nbe allowed to say so): that is a morality of method which one may not\nrepudiate nowadays\u2014it follows \"from its definition,\" as mathematicians say.\nThe question is ultimately whether we really recognize the will as OPERATING,\nwhether we believe in the causality of the will; if we do so\u2014and fundamentally\nour belief IN THIS is just our belief in causality itself\u2014we MUST make the\nattempt to posit hypothetically the causality of the will as the only\ncausality. \"Will\" can naturally only operate on \"will\"\u2014and not on \"matter\"\n(not on \"nerves,\" for instance): in short, the hypothesis must be hazarded,\nwhether will does not operate on will wherever \"effects\" are recognized\u2014and\nwhether all mechanical action, inasmuch as a power operates therein, is not\njust the power of will, the effect of will.

Nobody will very readily regard a doctrine as true merely because it\nmakes people happy or virtuous\u2014excepting, perhaps, the amiable \"Idealists,\"\nwho are enthusiastic about the good, true, and beautiful, and let all kinds of\nmotley, coarse, and good-natured desirabilities swim about promiscuously in\ntheir pond. Happiness and virtue are no arguments. It is willingly forgotten,\nhowever, even on the part of thoughtful minds, that to make unhappy and to\nmake bad are just as little counter-arguments. A thing could be TRUE, although\nit were in the highest degree injurious and dangerous; indeed, the fundamental\nconstitution of existence might be such that one succumbed by a full knowledge\nof it\u2014so that the strength of a mind might be measured by the amount of\n\"truth\" it could endure\u2014or to speak more plainly, by the extent to which it\nREQUIRED truth attenuated, veiled, sweetened, damped, and falsified. But there\nis no doubt that for the discovery of certain PORTIONS of truth the wicked and\nunfortunate are more favourably situated and have a greater likelihood of\nsuccess; not to speak of the wicked who are happy\u2014a species about whom\nmoralists are silent. Perhaps severity and craft are more favourable\nconditions for the development of strong, independent spirits and philosophers\nthan the gentle, refined, yielding good-nature, and habit of taking things\neasily, which are prized, and rightly prized in a learned man.

Many a one is able to obscure and abuse his own memory, in order\nat least to have vengeance on this sole party in the secret: shame is\ninventive. They are not the worst things of which one is most ashamed: there\nis not only deceit behind a mask\u2014there is so much goodness in craft. I could\nimagine that a man with something costly and fragile to conceal, would roll\nthrough life clumsily and rotundly like an old, green, heavily-hooped wine-\ncask: the refinement of his shame requiring it to be so. A man who has depths\nin his shame meets his destiny and his delicate decisions upon paths which few\never reach, and with regard to the existence of which his nearest and most\nintimate friends may be ignorant; his mortal danger conceals itself from their\neyes, and equally so his regained security. Such a hidden nature, which\ninstinctively employs speech for silence and concealment, and is inexhaustible\nin evasion of communication, DESIRES and insists that a mask of himself shall\noccupy his place in the hearts and heads of his friends; and supposing he does\nnot desire it, his eyes will some day be opened to the fact that there is\nnevertheless a mask of him there\u2014and that it is well to be so. Every profound\nspirit needs a mask; nay, more, around every profound spirit there continually\ngrows a mask, owing to the constantly false, that is to say, SUPERFICIAL\ninterpretation of every word he utters, every step he takes, every sign of\nlife he manifests.\n\n41\\. One must subject oneself to one's own tests that one is destined for\nindependence and command, and do so at the right time. One must not avoid\none's tests, although they constitute perhaps the most dangerous game one can\nplay, and are in the end tests made only before ourselves and before no other\njudge. Not to cleave to any person, be it even the dearest\u2014every person is a\nprison and also a recess. Not to cleave to a fatherland, be it even the most\nsuffering and necessitous\u2014it is even less difficult to detach one's heart from\na victorious fatherland. Not to cleave to a sympathy, be it even for higher\nmen, into whose peculiar torture and helplessness chance has given us an\ninsight. Not to cleave to a science, though it tempt one with the most\nvaluable discoveries, apparently specially reserved for us. Not to cleave to\none's own liberation, to the voluptuous distance and remoteness of the bird,\nwhich always flies further aloft in order always to see more under it\u2014the\ndanger of the flier.

Will they be new friends of \"truth,\" these coming philosophers? Very\nprobably, for all philosophers hitherto have loved their truths. But assuredly\nthey will not be dogmatists. It must be contrary to their pride, and also\ncontrary to their taste, that their truth should still be truth for every\none\u2014that which has hitherto been the secret wish and ultimate purpose of all\ndogmatic efforts. \"My opinion is MY opinion: another person has not easily a\nright to it\"\u2014such a philosopher of the future will say, perhaps. One must\nrenounce the bad taste of wishing to agree with many people. \"Good\" is no\nlonger good when one's neighbour takes it into his mouth. And how could there\nbe a \"common good\"!

But while I\nsay this, I feel under OBLIGATION almost as much to them as to ourselves (we\nfree spirits who are their heralds and forerunners), to sweep away from\nourselves altogether a stupid old prejudice and misunderstanding, which, like\na fog, has too long made the conception of \"free spirit\" obscure.

This latter doubt is justified by the fact\nthat one of the most regular symptoms among savage as well as among civilized\npeoples is the most sudden and excessive sensuality, which then with equal\nsuddenness transforms into penitential paroxysms, world-renunciation, and\nwill-renunciation, both symptoms perhaps explainable as disguised epilepsy?\nBut nowhere is it MORE obligatory to put aside explanations around no other\ntype has there grown such a mass of absurdity and superstition, no other type\nseems to have been more interesting to men and even to philosophers\u2014perhaps it\nis time to become just a little indifferent here, to learn caution, or, better\nstill, to look AWAY, TO GO AWAY\u2014Yet in the background of the most recent\nphilosophy, that of Schopenhauer, we find almost as the problem in itself,\nthis terrible note of interrogation of the religious crisis and awakening.

How\nis the negation of will POSSIBLE? how is the saint possible?\u2014that seems to\nhave been the very question with which Schopenhauer made a start and became a\nphilosopher. And thus it was a genuine Schopenhauerian consequence, that his\nmost convinced adherent (perhaps also his last, as far as Germany is\nconcerned), namely, Richard Wagner, should bring his own life-work to an end\njust here, and should finally put that terrible and eternal type upon the\nstage as Kundry, type vecu, and as it loved and lived, at the very time that\nthe mad-doctors in almost all European countries had an opportunity to study\nthe type close at hand, wherever the religious neurosis\u2014or as I call it, \"the\nreligious mood\"\u2014made its latest epidemical outbreak and display as the\n\"Salvation Army\"\u2014If it be a question, however, as to what has been so\nextremely interesting to men of all sorts in all ages, and even to\nphilosophers, in the whole phenomenon of the saint, it is undoubtedly the\nappearance of the miraculous therein\u2014namely, the immediate SUCCESSION OF\nOPPOSITES, of states of the soul regarded as morally antithetical: it was\nbelieved here to be self-evident that a \"bad man\" was all at once turned into\na \"saint,\" a good man. The hitherto existing psychology was wrecked at this\npoint, is it not possible it may have happened principally because psychology\nhad placed itself under the dominion of morals, because it BELIEVED in\noppositions of moral values, and saw, read, and INTERPRETED these oppositions\ninto the text and facts of the case? What? \"Miracle\" only an error of\ninterpretation? A lack of philology?\n\n48\\. It seems that the Latin races are far more deeply attached to their\nCatholicism than we Northerners are to Christianity generally, and that\nconsequently unbelief in Catholic countries means something quite different\nfrom what it does among Protestants\u2014namely, a sort of revolt against the\nspirit of the race, while with us it is rather a return to the spirit (or non-\nspirit) of the race.\n\nWe Northerners undoubtedly derive our origin from barbarous races, even as\nregards our talents for religion\u2014we have POOR talents for it.

The passion for God: there are churlish, honest-hearted, and importunate\nkinds of it, like that of Luther\u2014the whole of Protestantism lacks the southern\nDELICATEZZA. There is an Oriental exaltation of the mind in it, like that of\nan undeservedly favoured or elevated slave, as in the case of St. Augustine,\nfor instance, who lacks in an offensive manner, all nobility in bearing and\ndesires. There is a feminine tenderness and sensuality in it, which modestly\nand unconsciously longs for a UNIO MYSTICA ET PHYSICA, as in the case of\nMadame de Guyon. In many cases it appears, curiously enough, as the disguise\nof a girl's or youth's puberty; here and there even as the hysteria of an old\nmaid, also as her last ambition. The Church has frequently canonized the woman\nin such a case.\n\n51\\. The mightiest men have hitherto always bowed reverently before the saint,\nas the enigma of self-subjugation and utter voluntary privation\u2014why did they\nthus bow? They divined in him\u2014and as it were behind the questionableness of\nhis frail and wretched appearance\u2014the superior force which wished to test\nitself by such a subjugation; the strength of will, in which they recognized\ntheir own strength and love of power, and knew how to honour it: they honoured\nsomething in themselves when they honoured the saint.

In the Jewish \"Old Testament,\" the book of divine justice, there are men,\nthings, and sayings on such an immense scale, that Greek and Indian literature\nhas nothing to compare with it. One stands with fear and reverence before\nthose stupendous remains of what man was formerly, and one has sad thoughts\nabout old Asia and its little out-pushed peninsula Europe, which would like,\nby all means, to figure before Asia as the \"Progress of Mankind.\" To be sure,\nhe who is himself only a slender, tame house-animal, and knows only the wants\nof a house-animal (like our cultured people of today, including the Christians\nof \"cultured\" Christianity), need neither be amazed nor even sad amid those\nruins\u2014the taste for the Old Testament is a touchstone with respect to \"great\"\nand \"small\": perhaps he will find that the New Testament, the book of grace,\nstill appeals more to his heart (there is much of the odour of the genuine,\ntender, stupid beadsman and petty soul in it). To have bound up this New\nTestament (a kind of ROCOCO of taste in every respect) along with the Old\nTestament into one book, as the \"Bible,\" as \"The Book in Itself,\" is perhaps\nthe greatest audacity and \"sin against the Spirit\" which literary Europe has\nupon its conscience.\n\n53\\. Why Atheism nowadays? \"The father\" in God is thoroughly refuted; equally\nso \"the judge,\" \"the rewarder.\" Also his \"free will\": he does not hear\u2014and\neven if he did, he would not know how to help. The worst is that he seems\nincapable of communicating himself clearly; is he uncertain?\u2014This is what I\nhave made out (by questioning and listening at a variety of conversations) to\nbe the cause of the decline of European theism; it appears to me that though\nthe religious instinct is in vigorous growth,\u2014it rejects the theistic\nsatisfaction with profound distrust.\n\n54\\. What does all modern philosophy mainly do? Since Descartes\u2014and indeed\nmore in defiance of him than on the basis of his procedure\u2014an ATTENTAT has\nbeen made on the part of all philosophers on the old conception of the soul,\nunder the guise of a criticism of the subject and predicate conception\u2014that is\nto say, an ATTENTAT on the fundamental presupposition of Christian doctrine.\nModern philosophy, as epistemological skepticism, is secretly or openly ANTI-\nCHRISTIAN, although (for keener ears, be it said) by no means anti-religious.\nFormerly, in effect, one believed in \"the soul\" as one believed in grammar and\nthe grammatical subject: one said, \"I\" is the condition, \"think\" is the\npredicate and is conditioned\u2014to think is an activity for which one MUST\nsuppose a subject as cause. The attempt was then made, with marvelous tenacity\nand subtlety, to see if one could not get out of this net,\u2014to see if the\nopposite was not perhaps true: \"think\" the condition, and \"I\" the conditioned;\n\"I,\" therefore, only a synthesis which has been MADE by thinking itself. KANT\nreally wished to prove that, starting from the subject, the subject could not\nbe proved\u2014nor the object either: the possibility of an APPARENT EXISTENCE of\nthe subject, and therefore of \"the soul,\" may not always have been strange to\nhim,\u2014the thought which once had an immense power on earth as the Vedanta\nphilosophy.\n\n55\\.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 103689, "end_char_idx": 107866, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "25edbeb7-e8f8-43e5-b93c-36e34934a536": {"__data__": {"id_": "25edbeb7-e8f8-43e5-b93c-36e34934a536", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9e1d2bf9-0587-4351-bf72-11d6b69e30c3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ff3048a679e97591cced124b82896a938ca8945069b5eb3931424fb508495fe1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0a0c864f-027d-4785-a071-93a56a4060be", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "908a8bad06bc4c5b9aa79486c9d33f44f334f23ebd41e3575ceb5c2de4ad6c06", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f025c518-95dc-4d2b-bf55-aa015a5abc1d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c73e74c87e3b83ffabbb73809eacaef55ec8f542ec666aa5f1bc31c414e53d2c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The attempt was then made, with marvelous tenacity\nand subtlety, to see if one could not get out of this net,\u2014to see if the\nopposite was not perhaps true: \"think\" the condition, and \"I\" the conditioned;\n\"I,\" therefore, only a synthesis which has been MADE by thinking itself.

There is a great ladder of religious cruelty, with many rounds; but three\nof these are the most important. Once on a time men sacrificed human beings to\ntheir God, and perhaps just those they loved the best\u2014to this category belong\nthe firstling sacrifices of all primitive religions, and also the sacrifice of\nthe Emperor Tiberius in the Mithra-Grotto on the Island of Capri, that most\nterrible of all Roman anachronisms. Then, during the moral epoch of mankind,\nthey sacrificed to their God the strongest instincts they possessed, their\n\"nature\"; THIS festal joy shines in the cruel glances of ascetics and \"anti-\nnatural\" fanatics. Finally, what still remained to be sacrificed? Was it not\nnecessary in the end for men to sacrifice everything comforting, holy,\nhealing, all hope, all faith in hidden harmonies, in future blessedness and\njustice? Was it not necessary to sacrifice God himself, and out of cruelty to\nthemselves to worship stone, stupidity, gravity, fate, nothingness? To\nsacrifice God for nothingness\u2014this paradoxical mystery of the ultimate cruelty\nhas been reserved for the rising generation; we all know something thereof\nalready.\n\n56\\. Whoever, like myself, prompted by some enigmatical desire, has long\nendeavoured to go to the bottom of the question of pessimism and free it from\nthe half-Christian, half-German narrowness and stupidity in which it has\nfinally presented itself to this century, namely, in the form of\nSchopenhauer's philosophy; whoever, with an Asiatic and super-Asiatic eye, has\nactually looked inside, and into the most world-renouncing of all possible\nmodes of thought\u2014beyond good and evil, and no longer like Buddha and\nSchopenhauer, under the dominion and delusion of morality,\u2014whoever has done\nthis, has perhaps just thereby, without really desiring it, opened his eyes to\nbehold the opposite ideal: the ideal of the most world-approving, exuberant,\nand vivacious man, who has not only learnt to compromise and arrange with that\nwhich was and is, but wishes to have it again AS IT WAS AND IS, for all\neternity, insatiably calling out da capo, not only to himself, but to the\nwhole piece and play; and not only the play, but actually to him who requires\nthe play\u2014and makes it necessary; because he always requires himself anew\u2014and\nmakes himself necessary.\u2014What? And this would not be\u2014circulus vitiosus deus?\n\n57\\.

Has it been observed to what extent outward idleness, or semi-idleness,\nis necessary to a real religious life (alike for its favourite microscopic\nlabour of self-examination, and for its soft placidity called \"prayer,\" the\nstate of perpetual readiness for the \"coming of God\"), I mean the idleness\nwith a good conscience, the idleness of olden times and of blood, to which the\naristocratic sentiment that work is DISHONOURING\u2014that it vulgarizes body and\nsoul\u2014is not quite unfamiliar? And that consequently the modern, noisy, time-\nengrossing, conceited, foolishly proud laboriousness educates and prepares for\n\"unbelief\" more than anything else? Among these, for instance, who are at\npresent living apart from religion in Germany, I find \"free-thinkers\" of\ndiversified species and origin, but above all a majority of those in whom\nlaboriousness from generation to generation has dissolved the religious\ninstincts; so that they no longer know what purpose religions serve, and only\nnote their existence in the world with a kind of dull astonishment. They feel\nthemselves already fully occupied, these good people, be it by their business\nor by their pleasures, not to mention the \"Fatherland,\" and the newspapers,\nand their \"family duties\"; it seems that they have no time whatever left for\nreligion; and above all, it is not obvious to them whether it is a question of\na new business or a new pleasure\u2014for it is impossible, they say to themselves,\nthat people should go to church merely to spoil their tempers. They are by no\nmeans enemies of religious customs; should certain circumstances, State\naffairs perhaps, require their participation in such customs, they do what is\nrequired, as so many things are done\u2014with a patient and unassuming\nseriousness, and without much curiosity or discomfort;\u2014they live too much\napart and outside to feel even the necessity for a FOR or AGAINST in such\nmatters. Among those indifferent persons may be reckoned nowadays the majority\nof German Protestants of the middle classes, especially in the great laborious\ncentres of trade and commerce; also the majority of laborious scholars, and\nthe entire University personnel (with the exception of the theologians, whose\nexistence and possibility there always gives psychologists new and more subtle\npuzzles to solve). On the part of pious, or merely church-going people, there\nis seldom any idea of HOW MUCH good-will, one might say arbitrary will, is now\nnecessary for a German scholar to take the problem of religion seriously; his\nwhole profession (and as I have said, his whole workmanlike laboriousness, to\nwhich he is compelled by his modern conscience) inclines him to a lofty and\nalmost charitable serenity as regards religion, with which is occasionally\nmingled a slight disdain for the \"uncleanliness\" of spirit which he takes for\ngranted wherever any one still professes to belong to the Church. It is only\nwith the help of history (NOT through his own personal experience, therefore)\nthat the scholar succeeds in bringing himself to a respectful seriousness, and\nto a certain timid deference in presence of religions; but even when his\nsentiments have reached the stage of gratitude towards them, he has not\npersonally advanced one step nearer to that which still maintains itself as\nChurch or as piety; perhaps even the contrary.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 110174, "end_char_idx": 114334, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e87d1ec-3b4b-4f7f-9348-bf3668f316d6": {"__data__": {"id_": "1e87d1ec-3b4b-4f7f-9348-bf3668f316d6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9e1d2bf9-0587-4351-bf72-11d6b69e30c3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ff3048a679e97591cced124b82896a938ca8945069b5eb3931424fb508495fe1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f025c518-95dc-4d2b-bf55-aa015a5abc1d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "cafe619200f5f63637405b857648110776b851ed76e033e9b2a32c17ed13897a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f8166afd-fafb-4851-a558-e9d60b7f7749", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "52505276dcff8e18eac2496cf6cb2394878dc2cf55acf01a656f7c1886a5317e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "It is only\nwith the help of history (NOT through his own personal experience, therefore)\nthat the scholar succeeds in bringing himself to a respectful seriousness, and\nto a certain timid deference in presence of religions; but even when his\nsentiments have reached the stage of gratitude towards them, he has not\npersonally advanced one step nearer to that which still maintains itself as\nChurch or as piety; perhaps even the contrary.

It is the profound, suspicious fear of an incurable pessimism\nwhich compels whole centuries to fasten their teeth into a religious\ninterpretation of existence: the fear of the instinct which divines that truth\nmight be attained TOO soon, before man has become strong enough, hard enough,\nartist enough.... Piety, the \"Life in God,\" regarded in this light, would\nappear as the most elaborate and ultimate product of the FEAR of truth, as\nartist-adoration and artist-intoxication in presence of the most logical of\nall falsifications, as the will to the inversion of truth, to untruth at any\nprice.

The selecting and\ndisciplining influence\u2014destructive, as well as creative and fashioning\u2014which\ncan be exercised by means of religion is manifold and varied, according to the\nsort of people placed under its spell and protection. For those who are strong\nand independent, destined and trained to command, in whom the judgment and\nskill of a ruling race is incorporated, religion is an additional means for\novercoming resistance in the exercise of authority\u2014as a bond which binds\nrulers and subjects in common, betraying and surrendering to the former the\nconscience of the latter, their inmost heart, which would fain escape\nobedience. And in the case of the unique natures of noble origin, if by virtue\nof superior spirituality they should incline to a more retired and\ncontemplative life, reserving to themselves only the more refined forms of\ngovernment (over chosen disciples or members of an order), religion itself may\nbe used as a means for obtaining peace from the noise and trouble of managing\nGROSSER affairs, and for securing immunity from the UNAVOIDABLE filth of all\npolitical agitation. The Brahmins, for instance, understood this fact. With\nthe help of a religious organization, they secured to themselves the power of\nnominating kings for the people, while their sentiments prompted them to keep\napart and outside, as men with a higher and super-regal mission. At the same\ntime religion gives inducement and opportunity to some of the subjects to\nqualify themselves for future ruling and commanding the slowly ascending ranks\nand classes, in which, through fortunate marriage customs, volitional power\nand delight in self-control are on the increase. To them religion offers\nsufficient incentives and temptations to aspire to higher intellectuality, and\nto experience the sentiments of authoritative self-control, of silence, and of\nsolitude. Asceticism and Puritanism are almost indispensable means of\neducating and ennobling a race which seeks to rise above its hereditary\nbaseness and work itself upwards to future supremacy. And finally, to ordinary\nmen, to the majority of the people, who exist for service and general utility,\nand are only so far entitled to exist, religion gives invaluable contentedness\nwith their lot and condition, peace of heart, ennoblement of obedience,\nadditional social happiness and sympathy, with something of transfiguration\nand embellishment, something of justification of all the commonplaceness, all\nthe meanness, all the semi-animal poverty of their souls. Religion, together\nwith the religious significance of life, sheds sunshine over such perpetually\nharassed men, and makes even their own aspect endurable to them, it operates\nupon them as the Epicurean philosophy usually operates upon sufferers of a\nhigher order, in a refreshing and refining manner, almost TURNING suffering TO\nACCOUNT, and in the end even hallowing and vindicating it. There is perhaps\nnothing so admirable in Christianity and Buddhism as their art of teaching\neven the lowest to elevate themselves by piety to a seemingly higher order of\nthings, and thereby to retain their satisfaction with the actual world in\nwhich they find it difficult enough to live\u2014this very difficulty being\nnecessary.\n\n62\\. To be sure\u2014to make also the bad counter-reckoning against such religions,\nand to bring to light their secret dangers\u2014the cost is always excessive and\nterrible when religions do NOT operate as an educational and disciplinary\nmedium in the hands of the philosopher, but rule voluntarily and PARAMOUNTLY,\nwhen they wish to be the final end, and not a means along with other means.\nAmong men, as among all other animals, there is a surplus of defective,\ndiseased, degenerating, infirm, and necessarily suffering individuals; the\nsuccessful cases, among men also, are always the exception; and in view of the\nfact that man is THE ANIMAL NOT YET PROPERLY ADAPTED TO HIS ENVIRONMENT, the\nrare exception.

However highly we may esteem this indulgent and\npreservative care (inasmuch as in applying to others, it has applied, and\napplies also to the highest and usually the most suffering type of man), the\nhitherto PARAMOUNT religions\u2014to give a general appreciation of them\u2014are among\nthe principal causes which have kept the type of \"man\" upon a lower level\u2014they\nhave preserved too much THAT WHICH SHOULD HAVE PERISHED.

The charm of knowledge would be small, were it not so much shame has to\nbe overcome on the way to it.\n\n65A. We are most dishonourable towards our God: he is not PERMITTED to sin.\n\n66\\. The tendency of a person to allow himself to be degraded, robbed,\ndeceived, and exploited might be the diffidence of a God among men.\n\n67\\. Love to one only is a barbarity, for it is exercised at the expense of\nall others. Love to God also!\n\n68\\. \"I did that,\" says my memory. \"I could not have done that,\" says my\npride, and remains inexorable. Eventually\u2014the memory yields.\n\n69\\.

THE NATURAL HISTORY OF MORALS\n\n186\\. The moral sentiment in Europe at present is perhaps as subtle, belated,\ndiverse, sensitive, and refined, as the \"Science of Morals\" belonging thereto\nis recent, initial, awkward, and coarse-fingered:\u2014an interesting contrast,\nwhich sometimes becomes incarnate and obvious in the very person of a\nmoralist. Indeed, the expression, \"Science of Morals\" is, in respect to what\nis designated thereby, far too presumptuous and counter to GOOD taste,\u2014which\nis always a foretaste of more modest expressions. One ought to avow with the\nutmost fairness WHAT is still necessary here for a long time, WHAT is alone\nproper for the present: namely, the collection of material, the comprehensive\nsurvey and classification of an immense domain of delicate sentiments of\nworth, and distinctions of worth, which live, grow, propagate, and perish\u2014and\nperhaps attempts to give a clear idea of the recurring and more common forms\nof these living crystallizations\u2014as preparation for a THEORY OF TYPES of\nmorality. To be sure, people have not hitherto been so modest. All the\nphilosophers, with a pedantic and ridiculous seriousness, demanded of\nthemselves something very much higher, more pretentious, and ceremonious, when\nthey concerned themselves with morality as a science: they wanted to GIVE A\nBASIC to morality\u2014and every philosopher hitherto has believed that he has\ngiven it a basis; morality itself, however, has been regarded as something\n\"given.\" How far from their awkward pride was the seemingly insignificant\nproblem\u2014left in dust and decay\u2014of a description of forms of morality,\nnotwithstanding that the finest hands and senses could hardly be fine enough\nfor it! It was precisely owing to moral philosophers' knowing the moral facts\nimperfectly, in an arbitrary epitome, or an accidental abridgement\u2014perhaps as\nthe morality of their environment, their position, their church, their\nZeitgeist, their climate and zone\u2014it was precisely because they were badly\ninstructed with regard to nations, eras, and past ages, and were by no means\neager to know about these matters, that they did not even come in sight of the\nreal problems of morals\u2014problems which only disclose themselves by a\ncomparison of MANY kinds of morality. In every \"Science of Morals\" hitherto,\nstrange as it may sound, the problem of morality itself has been OMITTED:\nthere has been no suspicion that there was anything problematic there! That\nwhich philosophers called \"giving a basis to morality,\" and endeavoured to\nrealize, has, when seen in a right light, proved merely a learned form of good\nFAITH in prevailing morality, a new means of its EXPRESSION, consequently just\na matter-of-fact within the sphere of a definite morality, yea, in its\nultimate motive, a sort of denial that it is LAWFUL for this morality to be\ncalled in question\u2014and in any case the reverse of the testing, analyzing,\ndoubting, and vivisecting of this very faith.

A\nquestion by the way: a pessimist, a repudiator of God and of the world, who\nMAKES A HALT at morality\u2014who assents to morality, and plays the flute to\nlaede-neminem morals, what? Is that really\u2014a pessimist?\n\n187\\. Apart from the value of such assertions as \"there is a categorical\nimperative in us,\" one can always ask: What does such an assertion indicate\nabout him who makes it? There are systems of morals which are meant to justify\ntheir author in the eyes of other people; other systems of morals are meant to\ntranquilize him, and make him self-satisfied; with other systems he wants to\ncrucify and humble himself, with others he wishes to take revenge, with others\nto conceal himself, with others to glorify himself and gave superiority and\ndistinction,\u2014this system of morals helps its author to forget, that system\nmakes him, or something of him, forgotten, many a moralist would like to\nexercise power and creative arbitrariness over mankind, many another, perhaps,\nKant especially, gives us to understand by his morals that \"what is estimable\nin me, is that I know how to obey\u2014and with you it SHALL not be otherwise than\nwith me!\" In short, systems of morals are only a SIGN-LANGUAGE OF THE\nEMOTIONS.\n\n188\\. In contrast to laisser-aller, every system of morals is a sort of\ntyranny against \"nature\" and also against \"reason\", that is, however, no\nobjection, unless one should again decree by some system of morals, that all\nkinds of tyranny and unreasonableness are unlawful What is essential and\ninvaluable in every system of morals, is that it is a long constraint. In\norder to understand Stoicism, or Port Royal, or Puritanism, one should\nremember the constraint under which every language has attained to strength\nand freedom\u2014the metrical constraint, the tyranny of rhyme and rhythm. How much\ntrouble have the poets and orators of every nation given themselves!\u2014not\nexcepting some of the prose writers of today, in whose ear dwells an\ninexorable conscientiousness\u2014\"for the sake of a folly,\" as utilitarian\nbunglers say, and thereby deem themselves wise\u2014\"from submission to arbitrary\nlaws,\" as the anarchists say, and thereby fancy themselves \"free,\" even free-\nspirited.

Many kinds of fasts are\nnecessary; and wherever powerful influences and habits prevail, legislators\nhave to see that intercalary days are appointed, on which such impulses are\nfettered, and learn to hunger anew. Viewed from a higher standpoint, whole\ngenerations and epochs, when they show themselves infected with any moral\nfanaticism, seem like those intercalated periods of restraint and fasting,\nduring which an impulse learns to humble and submit itself\u2014at the same time\nalso to PURIFY and SHARPEN itself; certain philosophical sects likewise admit\nof a similar interpretation (for instance, the Stoa, in the midst of Hellenic\nculture, with the atmosphere rank and overcharged with Aphrodisiacal\nodours).\u2014Here also is a hint for the explanation of the paradox, why it was\nprecisely in the most Christian period of European history, and in general\nonly under the pressure of Christian sentiments, that the sexual impulse\nsublimated into love (amour-passion).\n\n190\\. There is something in the morality of Plato which does not really belong\nto Plato, but which only appears in his philosophy, one might say, in spite of\nhim: namely, Socratism, for which he himself was too noble. \"No one desires to\ninjure himself, hence all evil is done unwittingly. The evil man inflicts\ninjury on himself; he would not do so, however, if he knew that evil is evil.\nThe evil man, therefore, is only evil through error; if one free him from\nerror one will necessarily make him\u2014good.\"\u2014This mode of reasoning savours of\nthe POPULACE, who perceive only the unpleasant consequences of evil-doing, and\npractically judge that \"it is STUPID to do wrong\"; while they accept \"good\" as\nidentical with \"useful and pleasant,\" without further thought. As regards\nevery system of utilitarianism, one may at once assume that it has the same\norigin, and follow the scent: one will seldom err.\u2014Plato did all he could to\ninterpret something refined and noble into the tenets of his teacher, and\nabove all to interpret himself into them\u2014he, the most daring of all\ninterpreters, who lifted the entire Socrates out of the street, as a popular\ntheme and song, to exhibit him in endless and impossible modifications\u2014namely,\nin all his own disguises and multiplicities.

The old theological problem of \"Faith\" and \"Knowledge,\" or more plainly,\nof instinct and reason\u2014the question whether, in respect to the valuation of\nthings, instinct deserves more authority than rationality, which wants to\nappreciate and act according to motives, according to a \"Why,\" that is to say,\nin conformity to purpose and utility\u2014it is always the old moral problem that\nfirst appeared in the person of Socrates, and had divided men's minds long\nbefore Christianity. Socrates himself, following, of course, the taste of his\ntalent\u2014that of a surpassing dialectician\u2014took first the side of reason; and,\nin fact, what did he do all his life but laugh at the awkward incapacity of\nthe noble Athenians, who were men of instinct, like all noble men, and could\nnever give satisfactory answers concerning the motives of their actions?

Our eyes\nfind it easier on a given occasion to produce a picture already often\nproduced, than to seize upon the divergence and novelty of an impression: the\nlatter requires more force, more \"morality.\" It is difficult and painful for\nthe ear to listen to anything new; we hear strange music badly. When we hear\nanother language spoken, we involuntarily attempt to form the sounds into\nwords with which we are more familiar and conversant\u2014it was thus, for example,\nthat the Germans modified the spoken word ARCUBALISTA into ARMBRUST (cross-\nbow). Our senses are also hostile and averse to the new; and generally, even\nin the \"simplest\" processes of sensation, the emotions DOMINATE\u2014such as fear,\nlove, hatred, and the passive emotion of indolence.\u2014As little as a reader\nnowadays reads all the single words (not to speak of syllables) of a page\u2014he\nrather takes about five out of every twenty words at random, and \"guesses\" the\nprobably appropriate sense to them\u2014just as little do we see a tree correctly\nand completely in respect to its leaves, branches, colour, and shape; we find\nit so much easier to fancy the chance of a tree.

How could he fail\u2014to long DIFFERENTLY for happiness?\n\"Flight,\" such as is described by poets, must, when compared with his own\n\"flying,\" be far too earthly, muscular, violent, far too \"troublesome\" for\nhim.\n\n194\\.

As regards a woman, for instance, the control over her body\nand her sexual gratification serves as an amply sufficient sign of ownership\nand possession to the more modest man; another with a more suspicious and\nambitious thirst for possession, sees the \"questionableness,\" the mere\napparentness of such ownership, and wishes to have finer tests in order to\nknow especially whether the woman not only gives herself to him, but also\ngives up for his sake what she has or would like to have\u2014only THEN does he\nlook upon her as \"possessed.\" A third, however, has not even here got to the\nlimit of his distrust and his desire for possession: he asks himself whether\nthe woman, when she gives up everything for him, does not perhaps do so for a\nphantom of him; he wishes first to be thoroughly, indeed, profoundly well\nknown; in order to be loved at all he ventures to let himself be found out.\nOnly then does he feel the beloved one fully in his possession, when she no\nlonger deceives herself about him, when she loves him just as much for the\nsake of his devilry and concealed insatiability, as for his goodness,\npatience, and spirituality. One man would like to possess a nation, and he\nfinds all the higher arts of Cagliostro and Catalina suitable for his purpose.\nAnother, with a more refined thirst for possession, says to himself: \"One may\nnot deceive where one desires to possess\"\u2014he is irritated and impatient at the\nidea that a mask of him should rule in the hearts of the people: \"I must,\ntherefore, MAKE myself known, and first of all learn to know myself!\"", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 157608, "end_char_idx": 161555, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ad35d1e-0259-464f-b6a8-880a5144cb0f": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ad35d1e-0259-464f-b6a8-880a5144cb0f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9e1d2bf9-0587-4351-bf72-11d6b69e30c3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ff3048a679e97591cced124b82896a938ca8945069b5eb3931424fb508495fe1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "92ec416e-d99c-4948-a8c3-0144fae7cb7d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "26252f427611abcc27f1b017c2f5a2d651b44713cef802b77147abb8b44bc0e4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "72a8c20b-5532-4652-80de-8a2840a4175f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3f8434b5c842a8ffd041216f8b6569f0bd17a7b913a78312e29da3e14f9cd2c1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Only then does he feel the beloved one fully in his possession, when she no\nlonger deceives herself about him, when she loves him just as much for the\nsake of his devilry and concealed insatiability, as for his goodness,\npatience, and spirituality.

Their prophets fused into one the expressions \"rich,\"\n\"godless,\" \"wicked,\" \"violent,\" \"sensual,\" and for the first time coined the\nword \"world\" as a term of reproach. In this inversion of valuations (in which\nis also included the use of the word \"poor\" as synonymous with \"saint\" and\n\"friend\") the significance of the Jewish people is to be found; it is with\nTHEM that the SLAVE-INSURRECTION IN MORALS commences.\n\n196\\.

This condition of things actually exists in Europe at\npresent\u2014I call it the moral hypocrisy of the commanding class. They know no\nother way of protecting themselves from their bad conscience than by playing\nthe role of executors of older and higher orders (of predecessors, of the\nconstitution, of justice, of the law, or of God himself), or they even justify\nthemselves by maxims from the current opinions of the herd, as \"first servants\nof their people,\" or \"instruments of the public weal\".

In cases, however, where it is believed that the\nleader and bell-wether cannot be dispensed with, attempt after attempt is made\nnowadays to replace commanders by the summing together of clever gregarious\nmen all representative constitutions, for example, are of this origin.

How much or how little dangerousness\nto the community or to equality is contained in an opinion, a condition, an\nemotion, a disposition, or an endowment\u2014that is now the moral perspective,\nhere again fear is the mother of morals. It is by the loftiest and strongest\ninstincts, when they break out passionately and carry the individual far above\nand beyond the average, and the low level of the gregarious conscience, that\nthe self-reliance of the community is destroyed, its belief in itself, its\nbackbone, as it were, breaks, consequently these very instincts will be most\nbranded and defamed. The lofty independent spirituality, the will to stand\nalone, and even the cogent reason, are felt to be dangers, everything that\nelevates the individual above the herd, and is a source of fear to the\nneighbour, is henceforth called EVIL, the tolerant, unassuming, self-adapting,\nself-equalizing disposition, the MEDIOCRITY of desires, attains to moral\ndistinction and honour. Finally, under very peaceful circumstances, there is\nalways less opportunity and necessity for training the feelings to severity\nand rigour, and now every form of severity, even in justice, begins to disturb\nthe conscience, a lofty and rigorous nobleness and self-responsibility almost\noffends, and awakens distrust, \"the lamb,\" and still more \"the sheep,\" wins\nrespect.

Let us at once say again what we have already said a hundred times, for\npeople's ears nowadays are unwilling to hear such truths\u2014OUR truths. We know\nwell enough how offensive it sounds when any one plainly, and without\nmetaphor, counts man among the animals, but it will be accounted to us almost\na CRIME, that it is precisely in respect to men of \"modern ideas\" that we have\nconstantly applied the terms \"herd,\" \"herd-instincts,\" and such like\nexpressions. What avail is it? We cannot do otherwise, for it is precisely\nhere that our new insight is. We have found that in all the principal moral\njudgments, Europe has become unanimous, including likewise the countries where\nEuropean influence prevails in Europe people evidently KNOW what Socrates\nthought he did not know, and what the famous serpent of old once promised to\nteach\u2014they \"know\" today what is good and evil. It must then sound hard and be\ndistasteful to the ear, when we always insist that that which here thinks it\nknows, that which here glorifies itself with praise and blame, and calls\nitself good, is the instinct of the herding human animal, the instinct which\nhas come and is ever coming more and more to the front, to preponderance and\nsupremacy over other instincts, according to the increasing physiological\napproximation and resemblance of which it is the symptom. MORALITY IN EUROPE\nAT PRESENT IS HERDING-ANIMAL MORALITY, and therefore, as we understand the\nmatter, only one kind of human morality, beside which, before which, and after\nwhich many other moralities, and above all HIGHER moralities, are or should be\npossible. Against such a \"possibility,\" against such a \"should be,\" however,\nthis morality defends itself with all its strength, it says obstinately and\ninexorably \"I am morality itself and nothing else is morality!\" Indeed, with\nthe help of a religion which has humoured and flattered the sublimest desires\nof the herding-animal, things have reached such a point that we always find a\nmore visible expression of this morality even in political and social\narrangements: the DEMOCRATIC movement is the inheritance of the Christian\nmovement.

The\ndeclaration of independence of the scientific man, his emancipation from\nphilosophy, is one of the subtler after-effects of democratic organization and\ndisorganization: the self-glorification and self-conceitedness of the learned\nman is now everywhere in full bloom, and in its best springtime\u2014which does not\nmean to imply that in this case self-praise smells sweet. Here also the\ninstinct of the populace cries, \"Freedom from all masters!\" and after science\nhas, with the happiest results, resisted theology, whose \"hand-maid\" it had\nbeen too long, it now proposes in its wantonness and indiscretion to lay down\nlaws for philosophy, and in its turn to play the \"master\"\u2014what am I saying! to\nplay the PHILOSOPHER on its own account. My memory\u2014the memory of a scientific\nman, if you please!\u2014teems with the naivetes of insolence which I have heard\nabout philosophy and philosophers from young naturalists and old physicians\n(not to mention the most cultured and most conceited of all learned men, the\nphilologists and schoolmasters, who are both the one and the other by\nprofession). On one occasion it was the specialist and the Jack Horner who\ninstinctively stood on the defensive against all synthetic tasks and\ncapabilities; at another time it was the industrious worker who had got a\nscent of OTIUM and refined luxuriousness in the internal economy of the\nphilosopher, and felt himself aggrieved and belittled thereby. On another\noccasion it was the colour-blindness of the utilitarian, who sees nothing in\nphilosophy but a series of REFUTED systems, and an extravagant expenditure\nwhich \"does nobody any good\". At another time the fear of disguised mysticism\nand of the boundary-adjustment of knowledge became conspicuous, at another\ntime the disregard of individual philosophers, which had involuntarily\nextended to disregard of philosophy generally. In fine, I found most\nfrequently, behind the proud disdain of philosophy in young scholars, the evil\nafter-effect of some particular philosopher, to whom on the whole obedience\nhad been foresworn, without, however, the spell of his scornful estimates of\nother philosophers having been got rid of\u2014the result being a general ill-will\nto all philosophy. (Such seems to me, for instance, the after-effect of\nSchopenhauer on the most modern Germany: by his unintelligent rage against\nHegel, he has succeeded in severing the whole of the last generation of\nGermans from its connection with German culture, which culture, all things\nconsidered, has been an elevation and a divining refinement of the HISTORICAL\nSENSE, but precisely at this point Schopenhauer himself was poor, irreceptive,\nand un-German to the extent of ingeniousness.)

Let it but be acknowledged to what an extent our\nmodern world diverges from the whole style of the world of Heraclitus, Plato,\nEmpedocles, and whatever else all the royal and magnificent anchorites of the\nspirit were called, and with what justice an honest man of science MAY feel\nhimself of a better family and origin, in view of such representatives of\nphilosophy, who, owing to the fashion of the present day, are just as much\naloft as they are down below\u2014in Germany, for instance, the two lions of\nBerlin, the anarchist Eugen Duhring and the amalgamist Eduard von Hartmann. It\nis especially the sight of those hotch-potch philosophers, who call themselves\n\"realists,\" or \"positivists,\" which is calculated to implant a dangerous\ndistrust in the soul of a young and ambitious scholar those philosophers, at\nthe best, are themselves but scholars and specialists, that is very evident!\nAll of them are persons who have been vanquished and BROUGHT BACK AGAIN under\nthe dominion of science, who at one time or another claimed more from\nthemselves, without having a right to the \"more\" and its responsibility\u2014and\nwho now, creditably, rancorously, and vindictively, represent in word and\ndeed, DISBELIEF in the master-task and supremacy of philosophy After all, how\ncould it be otherwise? Science flourishes nowadays and has the good conscience\nclearly visible on its countenance, while that to which the entire modern\nphilosophy has gradually sunk, the remnant of philosophy of the present day,\nexcites distrust and displeasure, if not scorn and pity Philosophy reduced to\na \"theory of knowledge,\" no more in fact than a diffident science of epochs\nand doctrine of forbearance a philosophy that never even gets beyond the\nthreshold, and rigorously DENIES itself the right to enter\u2014that is philosophy\nin its last throes, an end, an agony, something that awakens pity. How could\nsuch a philosophy\u2014RULE!\n\n205\\. The dangers that beset the evolution of the philosopher are, in fact, so\nmanifold nowadays, that one might doubt whether this fruit could still come to\nmaturity. The extent and towering structure of the sciences have increased\nenormously, and therewith also the probability that the philosopher will grow\ntired even as a learner, or will attach himself somewhere and \"specialize\" so\nthat he will no longer attain to his elevation, that is to say, to his\nsuperspection, his circumspection, and his DESPECTION. Or he gets aloft too\nlate, when the best of his maturity and strength is past, or when he is\nimpaired, coarsened, and deteriorated, so that his view, his general estimate\nof things, is no longer of much importance.

This is in the last instance a question of taste, if it has not\nreally been a question of conscience. To double once more the philosopher's\ndifficulties, there is also the fact that he demands from himself a verdict, a\nYea or Nay, not concerning science, but concerning life and the worth of\nlife\u2014he learns unwillingly to believe that it is his right and even his duty\nto obtain this verdict, and he has to seek his way to the right and the belief\nonly through the most extensive (perhaps disturbing and destroying)\nexperiences, often hesitating, doubting, and dumbfounded.

In relation to the genius, that is to say, a being who either ENGENDERS\nor PRODUCES\u2014both words understood in their fullest sense\u2014the man of learning,\nthe scientific average man, has always something of the old maid about him;\nfor, like her, he is not conversant with the two principal functions of man.\nTo both, of course, to the scholar and to the old maid, one concedes\nrespectability, as if by way of indemnification\u2014in these cases one emphasizes\nthe respectability\u2014and yet, in the compulsion of this concession, one has the\nsame admixture of vexation. Let us examine more closely: what is the\nscientific man? Firstly, a commonplace type of man, with commonplace virtues:\nthat is to say, a non-ruling, non-authoritative, and non-self-sufficient type\nof man; he possesses industry, patient adaptableness to rank and file,\nequability and moderation in capacity and requirement; he has the instinct for\npeople like himself, and for that which they require\u2014for instance: the portion\nof independence and green meadow without which there is no rest from labour,\nthe claim to honour and consideration (which first and foremost presupposes\nrecognition and recognisability), the sunshine of a good name, the perpetual\nratification of his value and usefulness, with which the inward DISTRUST which\nlies at the bottom of the heart of all dependent men and gregarious animals,\nhas again and again to be overcome. The learned man, as is appropriate, has\nalso maladies and faults of an ignoble kind: he is full of petty envy, and has\na lynx-eye for the weak points in those natures to whose elevations he cannot\nattain. He is confiding, yet only as one who lets himself go, but does not\nFLOW; and precisely before the man of the great current he stands all the\ncolder and more reserved\u2014his eye is then like a smooth and irresponsive lake,\nwhich is no longer moved by rapture or sympathy.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 190246, "end_char_idx": 194122, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d7d3132a-c9f6-4956-bc14-cbf6e5c66591": {"__data__": {"id_": "d7d3132a-c9f6-4956-bc14-cbf6e5c66591", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9e1d2bf9-0587-4351-bf72-11d6b69e30c3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ff3048a679e97591cced124b82896a938ca8945069b5eb3931424fb508495fe1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d1cce7c2-c83f-40ab-87ce-2e3585af83c4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "00e160e39641b296d4532a40930bcd43e4b8e14791ee5ab6030ed584c93d3762", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "eec2c912-2436-4ef5-9082-24e256320833", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6f428e63a1350d4b64e28a5b767ce44bd10f8a769e21cc8e39a48ceb0d6223", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The learned man, as is appropriate, has\nalso maladies and faults of an ignoble kind: he is full of petty envy, and has\na lynx-eye for the weak points in those natures to whose elevations he cannot\nattain.

As to how far the new warlike age on which we Europeans have evidently\nentered may perhaps favour the growth of another and stronger kind of\nskepticism, I should like to express myself preliminarily merely by a parable,\nwhich the lovers of German history will already understand. That unscrupulous\nenthusiast for big, handsome grenadiers (who, as King of Prussia, brought into\nbeing a military and skeptical genius\u2014and therewith, in reality, the new and\nnow triumphantly emerged type of German), the problematic, crazy father of\nFrederick the Great, had on one point the very knack and lucky grasp of the\ngenius: he knew what was then lacking in Germany, the want of which was a\nhundred times more alarming and serious than any lack of culture and social\nform\u2014his ill-will to the young Frederick resulted from the anxiety of a\nprofound instinct. MEN WERE LACKING; and he suspected, to his bitterest\nregret, that his own son was not man enough. There, however, he deceived\nhimself; but who would not have deceived himself in his place? He saw his son\nlapsed to atheism, to the ESPRIT, to the pleasant frivolity of clever\nFrenchmen\u2014he saw in the background the great bloodsucker, the spider\nskepticism; he suspected the incurable wretchedness of a heart no longer hard\nenough either for evil or good, and of a broken will that no longer commands,\nis no longer ABLE to command. Meanwhile, however, there grew up in his son\nthat new kind of harder and more dangerous skepticism\u2014who knows TO WHAT EXTENT\nit was encouraged just by his father's hatred and the icy melancholy of a will\ncondemned to solitude?\u2014the skepticism of daring manliness, which is closely\nrelated to the genius for war and conquest, and made its first entrance into\nGermany in the person of the great Frederick. This skepticism despises and\nnevertheless grasps; it undermines and takes possession; it does not believe,\nbut it does not thereby lose itself; it gives the spirit a dangerous liberty,\nbut it keeps strict guard over the heart. It is the GERMAN form of skepticism,\nwhich, as a continued Fredericianism, risen to the highest spirituality, has\nkept Europe for a considerable time under the dominion of the German spirit\nand its critical and historical distrust Owing to the insuperably strong and\ntough masculine character of the great German philologists and historical\ncritics (who, rightly estimated, were also all of them artists of destruction\nand dissolution), a NEW conception of the German spirit gradually established\nitself\u2014in spite of all Romanticism in music and philosophy\u2014in which the\nleaning towards masculine skepticism was decidedly prominent whether, for\ninstance, as fearlessness of gaze, as courage and sternness of the dissecting\nhand, or as resolute will to dangerous voyages of discovery, to spiritualized\nNorth Pole expeditions under barren and dangerous skies. There may be good\ngrounds for it when warm-blooded and superficial humanitarians cross\nthemselves before this spirit, CET ESPRIT FATALISTE, IRONIQUE,\nMEPHISTOPHELIQUE, as Michelet calls it, not without a shudder. But if one\nwould realize how characteristic is this fear of the \"man\" in the German\nspirit which awakened Europe out of its \"dogmatic slumber,\" let us call to\nmind the former conception which had to be overcome by this new one\u2014and that\nit is not so very long ago that a masculinized woman could dare, with\nunbridled presumption, to recommend the Germans to the interest of Europe as\ngentle, good-hearted, weak-willed, and poetical fools. Finally, let us only\nunderstand profoundly enough Napoleon's astonishment when he saw Goethe it\nreveals what had been regarded for centuries as the \"German spirit\" \"VOILA UN\nHOMME!\"\u2014that was as much as to say \"But this is a MAN! And I only expected to\nsee a German!\"\n\n210\\.

With equal right they might call themselves\ncritics, and assuredly they will be men of experiments. By the name with which\nI ventured to baptize them, I have already expressly emphasized their\nattempting and their love of attempting is this because, as critics in body\nand soul, they will love to make use of experiments in a new, and perhaps\nwider and more dangerous sense? In their passion for knowledge, will they have\nto go further in daring and painful attempts than the sensitive and pampered\ntaste of a democratic century can approve of?\u2014There is no doubt these coming\nones will be least able to dispense with the serious and not unscrupulous\nqualities which distinguish the critic from the skeptic I mean the certainty\nas to standards of worth, the conscious employment of a unity of method, the\nwary courage, the standing-alone, and the capacity for self-responsibility,\nindeed, they will avow among themselves a DELIGHT in denial and dissection,\nand a certain considerate cruelty, which knows how to handle the knife surely\nand deftly, even when the heart bleeds They will be STERNER (and perhaps not\nalways towards themselves only) than humane people may desire, they will not\ndeal with the \"truth\" in order that it may \"please\" them, or \"elevate\" and\n\"inspire\" them\u2014they will rather have little faith in \"TRUTH\" bringing with it\nsuch revels for the feelings. They will smile, those rigorous spirits, when\nany one says in their presence \"That thought elevates me, why should it not be\ntrue?\" or \"That work enchants me, why should it not be beautiful?\" or \"That\nartist enlarges me, why should he not be great?\" Perhaps they will not only\nhave a smile, but a genuine disgust for all that is thus rapturous,\nidealistic, feminine, and hermaphroditic, and if any one could look into their\ninmost hearts, he would not easily find therein the intention to reconcile\n\"Christian sentiments\" with \"antique taste,\" or even with \"modern\nparliamentarism\" (the kind of reconciliation necessarily found even among\nphilosophers in our very uncertain and consequently very conciliatory\ncentury).

It may be necessary for the education of the real\nphilosopher that he himself should have once stood upon all those steps upon\nwhich his servants, the scientific workers of philosophy, remain standing, and\nMUST remain standing he himself must perhaps have been critic, and dogmatist,\nand historian, and besides, poet, and collector, and traveler, and riddle-\nreader, and moralist, and seer, and \"free spirit,\" and almost everything, in\norder to traverse the whole range of human values and estimations, and that he\nmay BE ABLE with a variety of eyes and consciences to look from a height to\nany distance, from a depth up to any height, from a nook into any expanse. But\nall these are only preliminary conditions for his task; this task itself\ndemands something else\u2014it requires him TO CREATE VALUES. The philosophical\nworkers, after the excellent pattern of Kant and Hegel, have to fix and\nformalize some great existing body of valuations\u2014that is to say, former\nDETERMINATIONS OF VALUE, creations of value, which have become prevalent, and\nare for a time called \"truths\"\u2014whether in the domain of the LOGICAL, the\nPOLITICAL (moral), or the ARTISTIC. It is for these investigators to make\nwhatever has happened and been esteemed hitherto, conspicuous, conceivable,\nintelligible, and manageable, to shorten everything long, even \"time\" itself,\nand to SUBJUGATE the entire past: an immense and wonderful task, in the\ncarrying out of which all refined pride, all tenacious will, can surely find\nsatisfaction. THE REAL PHILOSOPHERS, HOWEVER, ARE COMMANDERS AND LAW-GIVERS;\nthey say: \"Thus SHALL it be!\" They determine first the Whither and the Why of\nmankind, and thereby set aside the previous labour of all philosophical\nworkers, and all subjugators of the past\u2014they grasp at the future with a\ncreative hand, and whatever is and was, becomes for them thereby a means, an\ninstrument, and a hammer. Their \"knowing\" is CREATING, their creating is a\nlaw-giving, their will to truth is\u2014WILL TO POWER.\u2014Are there at present such\nphilosophers? Have there ever been such philosophers? MUST there not be such\nphilosophers some day? ...\n\n212\\. It is always more obvious to me that the philosopher, as a man\nINDISPENSABLE for the morrow and the day after the morrow, has ever found\nhimself, and HAS BEEN OBLIGED to find himself, in contradiction to the day in\nwhich he lives; his enemy has always been the ideal of his day.

The fact that at present people all talk of things of which they\nCANNOT have any experience, is true more especially and unfortunately as\nconcerns the philosopher and philosophical matters:\u2014the very few know them,\nare permitted to know them, and all popular ideas about them are false. Thus,\nfor instance, the truly philosophical combination of a bold, exuberant\nspirituality which runs at presto pace, and a dialectic rigour and necessity\nwhich makes no false step, is unknown to most thinkers and scholars from their\nown experience, and therefore, should any one speak of it in their presence,\nit is incredible to them. They conceive of every necessity as troublesome, as\na painful compulsory obedience and state of constraint; thinking itself is\nregarded by them as something slow and hesitating, almost as a trouble, and\noften enough as \"worthy of the SWEAT of the noble\"\u2014but not at all as something\neasy and divine, closely related to dancing and exuberance! \"To think\" and to\ntake a matter \"seriously,\" \"arduously\"\u2014that is one and the same thing to them;\nsuch only has been their \"experience.\"\u2014Artists have here perhaps a finer\nintuition; they who know only too well that precisely when they no longer do\nanything \"arbitrarily,\" and everything of necessity, their feeling of freedom,\nof subtlety, of power, of creatively fixing, disposing, and shaping, reaches\nits climax\u2014in short, that necessity and \"freedom of will\" are then the same\nthing with them. There is, in fine, a gradation of rank in psychical states,\nto which the gradation of rank in the problems corresponds; and the highest\nproblems repel ruthlessly every one who ventures too near them, without being\npredestined for their solution by the loftiness and power of his spirituality.\nOf what use is it for nimble, everyday intellects, or clumsy, honest mechanics\nand empiricists to press, in their plebeian ambition, close to such problems,\nand as it were into this \"holy of holies\"\u2014as so often happens nowadays! But\ncoarse feet must never tread upon such carpets: this is provided for in the\nprimary law of things; the doors remain closed to those intruders, though they\nmay dash and break their heads thereon. People have always to be born to a\nhigh station, or, more definitely, they have to be BRED for it: a person has\nonly a right to philosophy\u2014taking the word in its higher significance\u2014in\nvirtue of his descent; the ancestors, the \"blood,\" decide here also. Many\ngenerations must have prepared the way for the coming of the philosopher; each\nof his virtues must have been separately acquired, nurtured, transmitted, and\nembodied; not only the bold, easy, delicate course and current of his\nthoughts, but above all the readiness for great responsibilities, the majesty\nof ruling glance and contemning look, the feeling of separation from the\nmultitude with their duties and virtues, the kindly patronage and defense of\nwhatever is misunderstood and calumniated, be it God or devil, the delight and\npractice of supreme justice, the art of commanding, the amplitude of will, the\nlingering eye which rarely admires, rarely looks up, rarely loves....\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  CHAPTER VII.

And is there anything finer than to SEARCH for one's own\nvirtues? Is it not almost to BELIEVE in one's own virtues? But this \"believing\nin one's own virtues\"\u2014is it not practically the same as what was formerly\ncalled one's \"good conscience,\" that long, respectable pigtail of an idea,\nwhich our grandfathers used to hang behind their heads, and often enough also\nbehind their understandings? It seems, therefore, that however little we may\nimagine ourselves to be old-fashioned and grandfatherly respectable in other\nrespects, in one thing we are nevertheless the worthy grandchildren of our\ngrandfathers, we last Europeans with good consciences: we also still wear\ntheir pigtail.\u2014Ah! if you only knew how soon, so very soon\u2014it will be\ndifferent!\n\n215\\. As in the stellar firmament there are sometimes two suns which determine\nthe path of one planet, and in certain cases suns of different colours shine\naround a single planet, now with red light, now with green, and then\nsimultaneously illumine and flood it with motley colours: so we modern men,\nowing to the complicated mechanism of our \"firmament,\" are determined by\nDIFFERENT moralities; our actions shine alternately in different colours, and\nare seldom unequivocal\u2014and there are often cases, also, in which our actions\nare MOTLEY-COLOURED.\n\n216\\. To love one's enemies? I think that has been well learnt: it takes place\nthousands of times at present on a large and small scale; indeed, at times the\nhigher and sublimer thing takes place:\u2014we learn to DESPISE when we love, and\nprecisely when we love best; all of it, however, unconsciously, without noise,\nwithout ostentation, with the shame and secrecy of goodness, which forbids the\nutterance of the pompous word and the formula of virtue. Morality as\nattitude\u2014is opposed to our taste nowadays. This is ALSO an advance, as it was\nan advance in our fathers that religion as an attitude finally became opposed\nto their taste, including the enmity and Voltairean bitterness against\nreligion (and all that formerly belonged to freethinker-pantomime). It is the\nmusic in our conscience, the dance in our spirit, to which Puritan litanies,\nmoral sermons, and goody-goodness won't chime.\n\n217\\.

In short, the question is always who HE is, and who THE OTHER\nis. For instance, in a person created and destined for command, self-denial\nand modest retirement, instead of being virtues, would be the waste of\nvirtues: so it seems to me. Every system of unegoistic morality which takes\nitself unconditionally and appeals to every one, not only sins against good\ntaste, but is also an incentive to sins of omission, an ADDITIONAL seduction\nunder the mask of philanthropy\u2014and precisely a seduction and injury to the\nhigher, rarer, and more privileged types of men. Moral systems must be\ncompelled first of all to bow before the GRADATIONS OF RANK; their presumption\nmust be driven home to their conscience\u2014until they thoroughly understand at\nlast that it is IMMORAL to say that 'what is right for one is proper for\nanother.'\"\u2014So said my moralistic pedant and bonhomme.

The historical sense (or the capacity for divining quickly the order of\nrank of the valuations according to which a people, a community, or an\nindividual has lived, the \"divining instinct\" for the relationships of these\nvaluations, for the relation of the authority of the valuations to the\nauthority of the operating forces),\u2014this historical sense, which we Europeans\nclaim as our specialty, has come to us in the train of the enchanting and mad\nsemi-barbarity into which Europe has been plunged by the democratic mingling\nof classes and races\u2014it is only the nineteenth century that has recognized\nthis faculty as its sixth sense. Owing to this mingling, the past of every\nform and mode of life, and of cultures which were formerly closely contiguous\nand superimposed on one another, flows forth into us \"modern souls\"; our\ninstincts now run back in all directions, we ourselves are a kind of chaos: in\nthe end, as we have said, the spirit perceives its advantage therein.

Not one of those ponderous, conscience-\nstricken herding-animals (who undertake to advocate the cause of egoism as\nconducive to the general welfare) wants to have any knowledge or inkling of\nthe facts that the \"general welfare\" is no ideal, no goal, no notion that can\nbe at all grasped, but is only a nostrum,\u2014that what is fair to one MAY NOT at\nall be fair to another, that the requirement of one morality for all is really\na detriment to higher men, in short, that there is a DISTINCTION OF RANK\nbetween man and man, and consequently between morality and morality. They are\nan unassuming and fundamentally mediocre species of men, these utilitarian\nEnglishmen, and, as already remarked, in so far as they are tedious, one\ncannot think highly enough of their utility.

What the\nRoman enjoys in the arena, the Christian in the ecstasies of the cross, the\nSpaniard at the sight of the faggot and stake, or of the bull-fight, the\npresent-day Japanese who presses his way to the tragedy, the workman of the\nParisian suburbs who has a homesickness for bloody revolutions, the\nWagnerienne who, with unhinged will, \"undergoes\" the performance of \"Tristan\nand Isolde\"\u2014what all these enjoy, and strive with mysterious ardour to drink\nin, is the philtre of the great Circe \"cruelty.\" Here, to be sure, we must put\naside entirely the blundering psychology of former times, which could only\nteach with regard to cruelty that it originated at the sight of the suffering\nof OTHERS: there is an abundant, super-abundant enjoyment even in one's own\nsuffering, in causing one's own suffering\u2014and wherever man has allowed himself\nto be persuaded to self-denial in the RELIGIOUS sense, or to self-mutilation,\nas among the Phoenicians and ascetics, or in general, to desensualisation,\ndecarnalisation, and contrition, to Puritanical repentance-spasms, to\nvivisection of conscience and to Pascal-like SACRIFIZIA DELL' INTELLETO, he is\nsecretly allured and impelled forwards by his cruelty, by the dangerous thrill\nof cruelty TOWARDS HIMSELF.\u2014Finally, let us consider that even the seeker of\nknowledge operates as an artist and glorifier of cruelty, in that he compels\nhis spirit to perceive AGAINST its own inclination, and often enough against\nthe wishes of his heart:\u2014he forces it to say Nay, where he would like to\naffirm, love, and adore; indeed, every instance of taking a thing profoundly\nand fundamentally, is a violation, an intentional injuring of the fundamental\nwill of the spirit, which instinctively aims at appearance and\nsuperficiality,\u2014even in every desire for knowledge there is a drop of cruelty.\n\n230\\. Perhaps what I have said here about a \"fundamental will of the spirit\"\nmay not be understood without further details; I may be allowed a word of\nexplanation.\u2014That imperious something which is popularly called \"the spirit,\"\nwishes to be master internally and externally, and to feel itself master; it\nhas the will of a multiplicity for a simplicity, a binding, taming, imperious,\nand essentially ruling will. Its requirements and capacities here, are the\nsame as those assigned by physiologists to everything that lives, grows, and\nmultiplies. The power of the spirit to appropriate foreign elements reveals\nitself in a strong tendency to assimilate the new to the old, to simplify the\nmanifold, to overlook or repudiate the absolutely contradictory; just as it\narbitrarily re-underlines, makes prominent, and falsifies for itself certain\ntraits and lines in the foreign elements, in every portion of the \"outside\nworld.\" Its object thereby is the incorporation of new \"experiences,\" the\nassortment of new things in the old arrangements\u2014in short, growth; or more\nproperly, the FEELING of growth, the feeling of increased power\u2014is its object.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 248654, "end_char_idx": 252725, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c2993d10-d9b0-4b0e-bfe2-76915b2db903": {"__data__": {"id_": "c2993d10-d9b0-4b0e-bfe2-76915b2db903", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9e1d2bf9-0587-4351-bf72-11d6b69e30c3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ff3048a679e97591cced124b82896a938ca8945069b5eb3931424fb508495fe1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d29b9b37-ab86-4fde-9d83-050cdbc27b02", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "f39dbaeccb222933d02f3a6fc80bea1dac9ee7bcdc1710cad48689034aee3117", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b7738c26-ff07-45fe-9f56-651563d0f55e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "131981c28e9622809645427f8178e2ffa3a1fca38e365e2f16f5c3cf0a9f4621", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Its requirements and capacities here, are the\nsame as those assigned by physiologists to everything that lives, grows, and\nmultiplies.

Learning alters us, it does what all nourishment does that does not\nmerely \"conserve\"\u2014as the physiologist knows. But at the bottom of our souls,\nquite \"down below,\" there is certainly something unteachable, a granite of\nspiritual fate, of predetermined decision and answer to predetermined, chosen\nquestions. In each cardinal problem there speaks an unchangeable \"I am this\";\na thinker cannot learn anew about man and woman, for instance, but can only\nlearn fully\u2014he can only follow to the end what is \"fixed\" about them in\nhimself. Occasionally we find certain solutions of problems which make strong\nbeliefs for us; perhaps they are henceforth called \"convictions.\" Later on\u2014one\nsees in them only footsteps to self-knowledge, guide-posts to the problem\nwhich we ourselves ARE\u2014or more correctly to the great stupidity which we\nembody, our spiritual fate, the UNTEACHABLE in us, quite \"down below.\"\u2014In view\nof this liberal compliment which I have just paid myself, permission will\nperhaps be more readily allowed me to utter some truths about \"woman as she\nis,\" provided that it is known at the outset how literally they are merely\u2014MY\ntruths.\n\n232\\.

Is it not in the very worst taste that woman thus sets\nherself up to be scientific? Enlightenment hitherto has fortunately been men's\naffair, men's gift\u2014we remained therewith \"among ourselves\"; and in the end, in\nview of all that women write about \"woman,\" we may well have considerable\ndoubt as to whether woman really DESIRES enlightenment about herself\u2014and CAN\ndesire it. If woman does not thereby seek a new ORNAMENT for herself\u2014I believe\nornamentation belongs to the eternally feminine?\u2014why, then, she wishes to make\nherself feared: perhaps she thereby wishes to get the mastery. But she does\nnot want truth\u2014what does woman care for truth? From the very first, nothing is\nmore foreign, more repugnant, or more hostile to woman than truth\u2014her great\nart is falsehood, her chief concern is appearance and beauty. Let us confess\nit, we men: we honour and love this very art and this very instinct in woman:\nwe who have the hard task, and for our recreation gladly seek the company of\nbeings under whose hands, glances, and delicate follies, our seriousness, our\ngravity, and profundity appear almost like follies to us. Finally, I ask the\nquestion: Did a woman herself ever acknowledge profundity in a woman's mind,\nor justice in a woman's heart? And is it not true that on the whole \"woman\"\nhas hitherto been most despised by woman herself, and not at all by us?\u2014We men\ndesire that woman should not continue to compromise herself by enlightening\nus; just as it was man's care and the consideration for woman, when the church\ndecreed: mulier taceat in ecclesia. It was to the benefit of woman when\nNapoleon gave the too eloquent Madame de Stael to understand: mulier taceat in\npoliticis!\u2014and in my opinion, he is a true friend of woman who calls out to\nwomen today: mulier taceat de mulierel.\n\n233\\. It betrays corruption of the instincts\u2014apart from the fact that it\nbetrays bad taste\u2014when a woman refers to Madame Roland, or Madame de Stael, or\nMonsieur George Sand, as though something were proved thereby in favour of\n\"woman as she is.\" Among men, these are the three comical women as they\nare\u2014nothing more!\u2014and just the best involuntary counter-arguments against\nfeminine emancipation and autonomy.\n\n234\\. Stupidity in the kitchen; woman as cook; the terrible thoughtlessness\nwith which the feeding of the family and the master of the house is managed!\nWoman does not understand what food means, and she insists on being cook! If\nwoman had been a thinking creature, she should certainly, as cook for\nthousands of years, have discovered the most important physiological facts,\nand should likewise have got possession of the healing art!

I have no doubt that every noble woman will oppose what Dante and Goethe\nbelieved about woman\u2014the former when he sang, \"ELLA GUARDAVA SUSO, ED IO IN\nLEI,\" and the latter when he interpreted it, \"the eternally feminine draws us\nALOFT\"; for THIS is just what she believes of the eternally masculine.\n\n237\\. SEVEN APOPHTHEGMS FOR WOMEN\n\nHow the longest ennui flees, When a man comes to our knees!\n\nAge, alas! and science staid, Furnish even weak virtue aid.\n\nSombre garb and silence meet: Dress for every dame\u2014discreet.\n\nWhom I thank when in my bliss? God!\u2014and my good tailoress!\n\nYoung, a flower-decked cavern home; Old, a dragon thence doth roam.\n\nNoble title, leg that's fine, Man as well: Oh, were HE mine!\n\nSpeech in brief and sense in mass\u2014Slippery for the jenny-ass!\n\n237A. Woman has hitherto been treated by men like birds, which, losing their\nway, have come down among them from an elevation: as something delicate,\nfragile, wild, strange, sweet, and animating\u2014but as something also which must\nbe cooped up to prevent it flying away.\n\n238\\. To be mistaken in the fundamental problem of \"man and woman,\" to deny\nhere the profoundest antagonism and the necessity for an eternally hostile\ntension, to dream here perhaps of equal rights, equal training, equal claims\nand obligations: that is a TYPICAL sign of shallow-mindedness; and a thinker\nwho has proved himself shallow at this dangerous spot\u2014shallow in instinct!\u2014may\ngenerally be regarded as suspicious, nay more, as betrayed, as discovered; he\nwill probably prove too \"short\" for all fundamental questions of life, future\nas well as present, and will be unable to descend into ANY of the depths. On\nthe other hand, a man who has depth of spirit as well as of desires, and has\nalso the depth of benevolence which is capable of severity and harshness, and\neasily confounded with them, can only think of woman as ORIENTALS do: he must\nconceive of her as a possession, as confinable property, as a being\npredestined for service and accomplishing her mission therein\u2014he must take his\nstand in this matter upon the immense rationality of Asia, upon the\nsuperiority of the instinct of Asia, as the Greeks did formerly; those best\nheirs and scholars of Asia\u2014who, as is well known, with their INCREASING\nculture and amplitude of power, from Homer to the time of Pericles, became\ngradually STRICTER towards woman, in short, more Oriental. HOW necessary, HOW\nlogical, even HOW humanely desirable this was, let us consider for ourselves!\n\n239\\. The weaker sex has in no previous age been treated with so much respect\nby men as at present\u2014this belongs to the tendency and fundamental taste of\ndemocracy, in the same way as disrespectfulness to old age\u2014what wonder is it\nthat abuse should be immediately made of this respect? They want more, they\nlearn to make claims, the tribute of respect is at last felt to be well-nigh\ngalling; rivalry for rights, indeed actual strife itself, would be preferred:\nin a word, woman is losing modesty.

And let us immediately add that she is\nalso losing taste. She is unlearning to FEAR man: but the woman who \"unlearns\nto fear\" sacrifices her most womanly instincts. That woman should venture\nforward when the fear-inspiring quality in man\u2014or more definitely, the MAN in\nman\u2014is no longer either desired or fully developed, is reasonable enough and\nalso intelligible enough; what is more difficult to understand is that\nprecisely thereby\u2014woman deteriorates. This is what is happening nowadays: let\nus not deceive ourselves about it! Wherever the industrial spirit has\ntriumphed over the military and aristocratic spirit, woman strives for the\neconomic and legal independence of a clerk: \"woman as clerkess\" is inscribed\non the portal of the modern society which is in course of formation. While she\nthus appropriates new rights, aspires to be \"master,\" and inscribes \"progress\"\nof woman on her flags and banners, the very opposite realises itself with\nterrible obviousness: WOMAN RETROGRADES. Since the French Revolution the\ninfluence of woman in Europe has DECLINED in proportion as she has increased\nher rights and claims; and the \"emancipation of woman,\" insofar as it is\ndesired and demanded by women themselves (and not only by masculine shallow-\npates), thus proves to be a remarkable symptom of the increased weakening and\ndeadening of the most womanly instincts. There is STUPIDITY in this movement,\nan almost masculine stupidity, of which a well-reared woman\u2014who is always a\nsensible woman\u2014might be heartily ashamed. To lose the intuition as to the\nground upon which she can most surely achieve victory; to neglect exercise in\nthe use of her proper weapons; to let-herself-go before man, perhaps even \"to\nthe book,\" where formerly she kept herself in control and in refined, artful\nhumility; to neutralize with her virtuous audacity man's faith in a VEILED,\nfundamentally different ideal in woman, something eternally, necessarily\nfeminine; to emphatically and loquaciously dissuade man from the idea that\nwoman must be preserved, cared for, protected, and indulged, like some\ndelicate, strangely wild, and often pleasant domestic animal; the clumsy and\nindignant collection of everything of the nature of servitude and bondage\nwhich the position of woman in the hitherto existing order of society has\nentailed and still entails (as though slavery were a counter-argument, and not\nrather a condition of every higher culture, of every elevation of\nculture):\u2014what does all this betoken, if not a disintegration of womanly\ninstincts, a defeminising? Certainly, there are enough of idiotic friends and\ncorrupters of woman among the learned asses of the masculine sex, who advise\nwoman to defeminize herself in this manner, and to imitate all the stupidities\nfrom which \"man\" in Europe, European \"manliness,\" suffers,\u2014who would like to\nlower woman to \"general culture,\" indeed even to newspaper reading and\nmeddling with politics. Here and there they wish even to make women into free\nspirits and literary workers: as though a woman without piety would not be\nsomething perfectly obnoxious or ludicrous to a profound and godless\nman;\u2014almost everywhere her nerves are being ruined by the most morbid and\ndangerous kind of music (our latest German music), and she is daily being made\nmore hysterical and more incapable of fulfilling her first and last function,\nthat of bearing robust children.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 264775, "end_char_idx": 268763, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ad3f252-2f75-4cc2-aa22-1784fa49cd5d": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ad3f252-2f75-4cc2-aa22-1784fa49cd5d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9e1d2bf9-0587-4351-bf72-11d6b69e30c3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ff3048a679e97591cced124b82896a938ca8945069b5eb3931424fb508495fe1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2c630e89-6bce-4f2f-942e-3c3f99fb9027", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "0ff65ff154fb2704c0ca190e42bc0175aac69c3a50645ffed7d3ea3be86d8d16", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e0834e86-9116-4071-b24d-6b63d59be2c7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3ef37b35b95e7a8a65cd2b8375f0fbc4a2d2a315238247b927ab2a204a440083", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Certainly, there are enough of idiotic friends and\ncorrupters of woman among the learned asses of the masculine sex, who advise\nwoman to defeminize herself in this manner, and to imitate all the stupidities\nfrom which \"man\" in Europe, European \"manliness,\" suffers,\u2014who would like to\nlower woman to \"general culture,\" indeed even to newspaper reading and\nmeddling with politics.

That which, in spite of fear, excites one's sympathy for\nthe dangerous and beautiful cat, \"woman,\" is that she seems more afflicted,\nmore vulnerable, more necessitous of love, and more condemned to\ndisillusionment than any other creature.

I HEARD, once again for the first time, Richard Wagner's overture to the\nMastersinger: it is a piece of magnificent, gorgeous, heavy, latter-day art,\nwhich has the pride to presuppose two centuries of music as still living, in\norder that it may be understood:\u2014it is an honour to Germans that such a pride\ndid not miscalculate! What flavours and forces, what seasons and climes do we\nnot find mingled in it!

Supposing a statesman were to bring his people into the position of\nbeing obliged henceforth to practise 'high politics,' for which they were by\nnature badly endowed and prepared, so that they would have to sacrifice their\nold and reliable virtues, out of love to a new and doubtful\nmediocrity;\u2014supposing a statesman were to condemn his people generally to\n'practise politics,' when they have hitherto had something better to do and\nthink about, and when in the depths of their souls they have been unable to\nfree themselves from a prudent loathing of the restlessness, emptiness, and\nnoisy wranglings of the essentially politics-practising nations;\u2014supposing\nsuch a statesman were to stimulate the slumbering passions and avidities of\nhis people, were to make a stigma out of their former diffidence and delight\nin aloofness, an offence out of their exoticism and hidden permanency, were to\ndepreciate their most radical proclivities, subvert their consciences, make\ntheir minds narrow, and their tastes 'national'\u2014what! a statesman who should\ndo all this, which his people would have to do penance for throughout their\nwhole future, if they had a future, such a statesman would be GREAT, would\nhe?\"\u2014\"Undoubtedly!\" replied the other old patriot vehemently, \"otherwise he\nCOULD NOT have done it!

There was a time when it was customary to call Germans \"deep\" by way of\ndistinction; but now that the most successful type of new Germanism is\ncovetous of quite other honours, and perhaps misses \"smartness\" in all that\nhas depth, it is almost opportune and patriotic to doubt whether we did not\nformerly deceive ourselves with that commendation: in short, whether German\ndepth is not at bottom something different and worse\u2014and something from which,\nthank God, we are on the point of successfully ridding ourselves. Let us try,\nthen, to relearn with regard to German depth; the only thing necessary for the\npurpose is a little vivisection of the German soul.\u2014The German soul is above\nall manifold, varied in its source, aggregated and super-imposed, rather than\nactually built: this is owing to its origin. A German who would embolden\nhimself to assert: \"Two souls, alas, dwell in my breast,\" would make a bad\nguess at the truth, or, more correctly, he would come far short of the truth\nabout the number of souls. As a people made up of the most extraordinary\nmixing and mingling of races, perhaps even with a preponderance of the pre-\nAryan element as the \"people of the centre\" in every sense of the term, the\nGermans are more intangible, more ample, more contradictory, more unknown,\nmore incalculable, more surprising, and even more terrifying than other\npeoples are to themselves:\u2014they escape DEFINITION, and are thereby alone the\ndespair of the French. It IS characteristic of the Germans that the question:\n\"What is German?\" never dies out among them. Kotzebue certainly knew his\nGermans well enough: \"We are known,\" they cried jubilantly to him\u2014but Sand\nalso thought he knew them. Jean Paul knew what he was doing when he declared\nhimself incensed at Fichte's lying but patriotic flatteries and\nexaggerations,\u2014but it is probable that Goethe thought differently about\nGermans from Jean Paul, even though he acknowledged him to be right with\nregard to Fichte.

There are words of Goethe in which\nhe condemns with impatient severity, as from a foreign land, that which\nGermans take a pride in, he once defined the famous German turn of mind as\n\"Indulgence towards its own and others' weaknesses.\" Was he wrong? it is\ncharacteristic of Germans that one is seldom entirely wrong about them. The\nGerman soul has passages and galleries in it, there are caves, hiding-places,\nand dungeons therein, its disorder has much of the charm of the mysterious,\nthe German is well acquainted with the bypaths to chaos. And as everything\nloves its symbol, so the German loves the clouds and all that is obscure,\nevolving, crepuscular, damp, and shrouded, it seems to him that everything\nuncertain, undeveloped, self-displacing, and growing is \"deep\". The German\nhimself does not EXIST, he is BECOMING, he is \"developing himself\".\n\"Development\" is therefore the essentially German discovery and hit in the\ngreat domain of philosophical formulas,\u2014a ruling idea, which, together with\nGerman beer and German music, is labouring to Germanise all Europe. Foreigners\nare astonished and attracted by the riddles which the conflicting nature at\nthe basis of the German soul propounds to them (riddles which Hegel\nsystematised and Richard Wagner has in the end set to music). \"Good-natured\nand spiteful\"\u2014such a juxtaposition, preposterous in the case of every other\npeople, is unfortunately only too often justified in Germany one has only to\nlive for a while among Swabians to know this! The clumsiness of the German\nscholar and his social distastefulness agree alarmingly well with his physical\nrope-dancing and nimble boldness, of which all the Gods have learnt to be\nafraid. If any one wishes to see the \"German soul\" demonstrated ad oculos, let\nhim only look at German taste, at German arts and manners what boorish\nindifference to \"taste\"! How the noblest and the commonest stand there in\njuxtaposition! How disorderly and how rich is the whole constitution of this\nsoul! The German DRAGS at his soul, he drags at everything he experiences. He\ndigests his events badly; he never gets \"done\" with them; and German depth is\noften only a difficult, hesitating \"digestion.\" And just as all chronic\ninvalids, all dyspeptics like what is convenient, so the German loves\n\"frankness\" and \"honesty\"; it is so CONVENIENT to be frank and honest!\u2014This\nconfidingness, this complaisance, this showing-the-cards of German HONESTY, is\nprobably the most dangerous and most successful disguise which the German is\nup to nowadays: it is his proper Mephistophelean art; with this he can \"still\nachieve much\"!", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 280593, "end_char_idx": 284189, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ad76987d-e913-41cd-87b6-f7b98bf27706": {"__data__": {"id_": "ad76987d-e913-41cd-87b6-f7b98bf27706", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9e1d2bf9-0587-4351-bf72-11d6b69e30c3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ff3048a679e97591cced124b82896a938ca8945069b5eb3931424fb508495fe1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9103e31c-b70c-4602-8c70-d811ee5cd006", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "d11fd4fc07c7df2a149872beaad010ef3f4fb7c7eb28f7cef46ff1a8555d440d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9e8a165a-69d4-4a63-af6f-fe56297d4da5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e728ebfa1ce70835cce0686066bf23709a1fbe3360cd32419922a05686e21994", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "How the noblest and the commonest stand there in\njuxtaposition!

Beethoven is the intermediate event between an old mellow soul that\nis constantly breaking down, and a future over-young soul that is always\nCOMING; there is spread over his music the twilight of eternal loss and\neternal extravagant hope,\u2014the same light in which Europe was bathed when it\ndreamed with Rousseau, when it danced round the Tree of Liberty of the\nRevolution, and finally almost fell down in adoration before Napoleon. But how\nrapidly does THIS very sentiment now pale, how difficult nowadays is even the\nAPPREHENSION of this sentiment, how strangely does the language of Rousseau,\nSchiller, Shelley, and Byron sound to our ear, in whom COLLECTIVELY the same\nfate of Europe was able to SPEAK, which knew how to SING in\nBeethoven!\u2014Whatever German music came afterwards, belongs to Romanticism, that\nis to say, to a movement which, historically considered, was still shorter,\nmore fleeting, and more superficial than that great interlude, the transition\nof Europe from Rousseau to Napoleon, and to the rise of democracy.

But with regard\nto Robert Schumann, who took things seriously, and has been taken seriously\nfrom the first\u2014he was the last that founded a school,\u2014do we not now regard it\nas a satisfaction, a relief, a deliverance, that this very Romanticism of\nSchumann's has been surmounted? Schumann, fleeing into the \"Saxon Switzerland\"\nof his soul, with a half Werther-like, half Jean-Paul-like nature (assuredly\nnot like Beethoven! assuredly not like Byron!)\u2014his MANFRED music is a mistake\nand a misunderstanding to the extent of injustice; Schumann, with his taste,\nwhich was fundamentally a PETTY taste (that is to say, a dangerous\npropensity\u2014doubly dangerous among Germans\u2014for quiet lyricism and intoxication\nof the feelings), going constantly apart, timidly withdrawing and retiring, a\nnoble weakling who revelled in nothing but anonymous joy and sorrow, from the\nbeginning a sort of girl and NOLI ME TANGERE\u2014this Schumann was already merely\na GERMAN event in music, and no longer a European event, as Beethoven had\nbeen, as in a still greater degree Mozart had been; with Schumann German music\nwas threatened with its greatest danger, that of LOSING THE VOICE FOR THE SOUL\nOF EUROPE and sinking into a merely national affair.\n\n246\\. What a torture are books written in German to a reader who has a THIRD\near! How indignantly he stands beside the slowly turning swamp of sounds\nwithout tune and rhythms without dance, which Germans call a \"book\"! And even\nthe German who READS books! How lazily, how reluctantly, how badly he reads!\nHow many Germans know, and consider it obligatory to know, that there is ART\nin every good sentence\u2014art which must be divined, if the sentence is to be\nunderstood! If there is a misunderstanding about its TEMPO, for instance, the\nsentence itself is misunderstood! That one must not be doubtful about the\nrhythm-determining syllables, that one should feel the breaking of the too-\nrigid symmetry as intentional and as a charm, that one should lend a fine and\npatient ear to every STACCATO and every RUBATO, that one should divine the\nsense in the sequence of the vowels and diphthongs, and how delicately and\nrichly they can be tinted and retinted in the order of their arrangement\u2014who\namong book-reading Germans is complaisant enough to recognize such duties and\nrequirements, and to listen to so much art and intention in language? After\nall, one just \"has no ear for it\"; and so the most marked contrasts of style\nare not heard, and the most delicate artistry is as it were SQUANDERED on the\ndeaf.\u2014These were my thoughts when I noticed how clumsily and unintuitively two\nmasters in the art of prose-writing have been confounded: one, whose words\ndrop down hesitatingly and coldly, as from the roof of a damp cave\u2014he counts\non their dull sound and echo; and another who manipulates his language like a\nflexible sword, and from his arm down into his toes feels the dangerous bliss\nof the quivering, over-sharp blade, which wishes to bite, hiss, and cut.\n\n247\\.

How little the German style has to do with harmony and with the ear, is\nshown by the fact that precisely our good musicians themselves write badly.\nThe German does not read aloud, he does not read for the ear, but only with\nhis eyes; he has put his ears away in the drawer for the time. In antiquity\nwhen a man read\u2014which was seldom enough\u2014he read something to himself, and in a\nloud voice; they were surprised when any one read silently, and sought\nsecretly the reason of it. In a loud voice: that is to say, with all the\nswellings, inflections, and variations of key and changes of TEMPO, in which\nthe ancient PUBLIC world took delight. The laws of the written style were then\nthe same as those of the spoken style; and these laws depended partly on the\nsurprising development and refined requirements of the ear and larynx; partly\non the strength, endurance, and power of the ancient lungs. In the ancient\nsense, a period is above all a physiological whole, inasmuch as it is\ncomprised in one breath. Such periods as occur in Demosthenes and Cicero,\nswelling twice and sinking twice, and all in one breath, were pleasures to the\nmen of ANTIQUITY, who knew by their own schooling how to appreciate the virtue\ntherein, the rareness and the difficulty in the deliverance of such a\nperiod;\u2014WE have really no right to the BIG period, we modern men, who are\nshort of breath in every sense! Those ancients, indeed, were all of them\ndilettanti in speaking, consequently connoisseurs, consequently critics\u2014they\nthus brought their orators to the highest pitch; in the same manner as in the\nlast century, when all Italian ladies and gentlemen knew how to sing, the\nvirtuosoship of song (and with it also the art of melody) reached its\nelevation. In Germany, however (until quite recently when a kind of platform\neloquence began shyly and awkwardly enough to flutter its young wings), there\nwas properly speaking only one kind of public and APPROXIMATELY artistical\ndiscourse\u2014that delivered from the pulpit. The preacher was the only one in\nGermany who knew the weight of a syllable or a word, in what manner a sentence\nstrikes, springs, rushes, flows, and comes to a close; he alone had a\nconscience in his ears, often enough a bad conscience: for reasons are not\nlacking why proficiency in oratory should be especially seldom attained by a\nGerman, or almost always too late. The masterpiece of German prose is\ntherefore with good reason the masterpiece of its greatest preacher: the BIBLE\nhas hitherto been the best German book. Compared with Luther's Bible, almost\neverything else is merely \"literature\"\u2014something which has not grown in\nGermany, and therefore has not taken and does not take root in German hearts,\nas the Bible has done.\n\n248\\. There are two kinds of geniuses: one which above all engenders and seeks\nto engender, and another which willingly lets itself be fructified and brings\nforth.

For this, we artists among the spectators and\nphilosophers, are\u2014grateful to the Jews.\n\n251\\. It must be taken into the bargain, if various clouds and disturbances\u2014in\nshort, slight attacks of stupidity\u2014pass over the spirit of a people that\nsuffers and WANTS to suffer from national nervous fever and political\nambition: for instance, among present-day Germans there is alternately the\nanti-French folly, the anti-Semitic folly, the anti-Polish folly, the\nChristian-romantic folly, the Wagnerian folly, the Teutonic folly, the\nPrussian folly (just look at those poor historians, the Sybels and\nTreitschkes, and their closely bandaged heads), and whatever else these little\nobscurations of the German spirit and conscience may be called. May it be\nforgiven me that I, too, when on a short daring sojourn on very infected\nground, did not remain wholly exempt from the disease, but like every one\nelse, began to entertain thoughts about matters which did not concern me\u2014the\nfirst symptom of political infection. About the Jews, for instance, listen to\nthe following:\u2014I have never yet met a German who was favourably inclined to\nthe Jews; and however decided the repudiation of actual anti-Semitism may be\non the part of all prudent and political men, this prudence and policy is not\nperhaps directed against the nature of the sentiment itself, but only against\nits dangerous excess, and especially against the distasteful and infamous\nexpression of this excess of sentiment;\u2014on this point we must not deceive\nourselves. That Germany has amply SUFFICIENT Jews, that the German stomach,\nthe German blood, has difficulty (and will long have difficulty) in disposing\nonly of this quantity of \"Jew\"\u2014as the Italian, the Frenchman, and the\nEnglishman have done by means of a stronger digestion:\u2014that is the\nunmistakable declaration and language of a general instinct, to which one must\nlisten and according to which one must act. \"Let no more Jews come in! And\nshut the doors, especially towards the East (also towards Austria)!\"\u2014thus\ncommands the instinct of a people whose nature is still feeble and uncertain,\nso that it could be easily wiped out, easily extinguished, by a stronger race.\nThe Jews, however, are beyond all doubt the strongest, toughest, and purest\nrace at present living in Europe, they know how to succeed even under the\nworst conditions (in fact better than under favourable ones), by means of\nvirtues of some sort, which one would like nowadays to label as vices\u2014owing\nabove all to a resolute faith which does not need to be ashamed before \"modern\nideas\", they alter only, WHEN they do alter, in the same way that the Russian\nEmpire makes its conquest\u2014as an empire that has plenty of time and is not of\nyesterday\u2014namely, according to the principle, \"as slowly as possible\"!

The English coarseness and\nrustic demureness is still most satisfactorily disguised by Christian\npantomime, and by praying and psalm-singing (or, more correctly, it is thereby\nexplained and differently expressed); and for the herd of drunkards and rakes\nwho formerly learned moral grunting under the influence of Methodism (and more\nrecently as the \"Salvation Army\"), a penitential fit may really be the\nrelatively highest manifestation of \"humanity\" to which they can be elevated:\nso much may reasonably be admitted. That, however, which offends even in the\nhumanest Englishman is his lack of music, to speak figuratively (and also\nliterally): he has neither rhythm nor dance in the movements of his soul and\nbody; indeed, not even the desire for rhythm and dance, for \"music.\" Listen to\nhim speaking; look at the most beautiful Englishwoman WALKING\u2014in no country on\nearth are there more beautiful doves and swans; finally, listen to them\nsinging! But I ask too much...\n\n253\\. There are truths which are best recognized by mediocre minds, because\nthey are best adapted for them, there are truths which only possess charms and\nseductive power for mediocre spirits:\u2014one is pushed to this probably\nunpleasant conclusion, now that the influence of respectable but mediocre\nEnglishmen\u2014I may mention Darwin, John Stuart Mill, and Herbert Spencer\u2014begins\nto gain the ascendancy in the middle-class region of European taste. Indeed,\nwho could doubt that it is a useful thing for SUCH minds to have the\nascendancy for a time? It would be an error to consider the highly developed\nand independently soaring minds as specially qualified for determining and\ncollecting many little common facts, and deducing conclusions from them; as\nexceptions, they are rather from the first in no very favourable position\ntowards those who are \"the rules.\" After all, they have more to do than merely\nto perceive:\u2014in effect, they have to BE something new, they have to SIGNIFY\nsomething new, they have to REPRESENT new values! The gulf between knowledge\nand capacity is perhaps greater, and also more mysterious, than one thinks:\nthe capable man in the grand style, the creator, will possibly have to be an\nignorant person;\u2014while on the other hand, for scientific discoveries like\nthose of Darwin, a certain narrowness, aridity, and industrious carefulness\n(in short, something English) may not be unfavourable for arriving at\nthem.\u2014Finally, let it not be forgotten that the English, with their profound\nmediocrity, brought about once before a general depression of European\nintelligence.\n\nWhat is called \"modern ideas,\" or \"the ideas of the eighteenth century,\" or\n\"French ideas\"\u2014that, consequently, against which the GERMAN mind rose up with\nprofound disgust\u2014is of English origin, there is no doubt about it. The French\nwere only the apes and actors of these ideas, their best soldiers, and\nlikewise, alas! their first and profoundest VICTIMS; for owing to the\ndiabolical Anglomania of \"modern ideas,\" the AME FRANCAIS has in the end\nbecome so thin and emaciated, that at present one recalls its sixteenth and\nseventeenth centuries, its profound, passionate strength, its inventive\nexcellency, almost with disbelief.

Even at present France is still the seat of the most intellectual and\nrefined culture of Europe, it is still the high school of taste; but one must\nknow how to find this \"France of taste.\" He who belongs to it keeps himself\nwell concealed:\u2014they may be a small number in whom it lives and is embodied,\nbesides perhaps being men who do not stand upon the strongest legs, in part\nfatalists, hypochondriacs, invalids, in part persons over-indulged, over-\nrefined, such as have the AMBITION to conceal themselves.\n\nThey have all something in common: they keep their ears closed in presence of\nthe delirious folly and noisy spouting of the democratic BOURGEOIS. In fact, a\nbesotted and brutalized France at present sprawls in the foreground\u2014it\nrecently celebrated a veritable orgy of bad taste, and at the same time of\nself-admiration, at the funeral of Victor Hugo. There is also something else\ncommon to them: a predilection to resist intellectual Germanizing\u2014and a still\ngreater inability to do so! In this France of intellect, which is also a\nFrance of pessimism, Schopenhauer has perhaps become more at home, and more\nindigenous than he has ever been in Germany; not to speak of Heinrich Heine,\nwho has long ago been re-incarnated in the more refined and fastidious lyrists\nof Paris; or of Hegel, who at present, in the form of Taine\u2014the FIRST of\nliving historians\u2014exercises an almost tyrannical influence. As regards Richard\nWagner, however, the more French music learns to adapt itself to the actual\nneeds of the AME MODERNE, the more will it \"Wagnerite\"; one can safely predict\nthat beforehand,\u2014it is already taking place sufficiently! There are, however,\nthree things which the French can still boast of with pride as their heritage\nand possession, and as indelible tokens of their ancient intellectual\nsuperiority in Europe, in spite of all voluntary or involuntary Germanizing\nand vulgarizing of taste. FIRSTLY, the capacity for artistic emotion, for\ndevotion to \"form,\" for which the expression, L'ART POUR L'ART, along with\nnumerous others, has been invented:\u2014such capacity has not been lacking in\nFrance for three centuries; and owing to its reverence for the \"small number,\"\nit has again and again made a sort of chamber music of literature possible,\nwhich is sought for in vain elsewhere in Europe.\u2014The SECOND thing whereby the\nFrench can lay claim to a superiority over Europe is their ancient, many-\nsided, MORALISTIC culture, owing to which one finds on an average, even in the\npetty ROMANCIERS of the newspapers and chance BOULEVARDIERS DE PARIS, a\npsychological sensitiveness and curiosity, of which, for example, one has no\nconception (to say nothing of the thing itself!) in Germany.

On a more subtle\ncomparison it will perhaps be found, to the honour of Richard Wagner's German\nnature, that he has acted in everything with more strength, daring, severity,\nand elevation than a nineteenth-century Frenchman could have done\u2014owing to the\ncircumstance that we Germans are as yet nearer to barbarism than the\nFrench;\u2014perhaps even the most remarkable creation of Richard Wagner is not\nonly at present, but for ever inaccessible, incomprehensible, and inimitable\nto the whole latter-day Latin race: the figure of Siegfried, that VERY FREE\nman, who is probably far too free, too hard, too cheerful, too healthy, too\nANTI-CATHOLIC for the taste of old and mellow civilized nations. He may even\nhave been a sin against Romanticism, this anti-Latin Siegfried: well, Wagner\natoned amply for this sin in his old sad days, when\u2014anticipating a taste which\nhas meanwhile passed into politics\u2014he began, with the religious vehemence\npeculiar to him, to preach, at least, THE WAY TO ROME, if not to walk\ntherein.\u2014That these last words may not be misunderstood, I will call to my aid\na few powerful rhymes, which will even betray to less delicate ears what I\nmean\u2014what I mean COUNTER TO the \"last Wagner\" and his Parsifal music:\u2014\n\n\u2014Is this our mode?\u2014From German heart came this vexed ululating?

EVERY elevation of the type \"man,\" has hitherto been the work of an\naristocratic society and so it will always be\u2014a society believing in a long\nscale of gradations of rank and differences of worth among human beings, and\nrequiring slavery in some form or other. Without the PATHOS OF DISTANCE, such\nas grows out of the incarnated difference of classes, out of the constant out-\nlooking and down-looking of the ruling caste on subordinates and instruments,\nand out of their equally constant practice of obeying and commanding, of\nkeeping down and keeping at a distance\u2014that other more mysterious pathos could\nnever have arisen, the longing for an ever new widening of distance within the\nsoul itself, the formation of ever higher, rarer, further, more extended, more\ncomprehensive states, in short, just the elevation of the type \"man,\" the\ncontinued \"self-surmounting of man,\" to use a moral formula in a supermoral\nsense. To be sure, one must not resign oneself to any humanitarian illusions\nabout the history of the origin of an aristocratic society (that is to say, of\nthe preliminary condition for the elevation of the type \"man\"): the truth is\nhard.

Let us acknowledge unprejudicedly how every higher civilization hitherto\nhas ORIGINATED! Men with a still natural nature, barbarians in every terrible\nsense of the word, men of prey, still in possession of unbroken strength of\nwill and desire for power, threw themselves upon weaker, more moral, more\npeaceful races (perhaps trading or cattle-rearing communities), or upon old\nmellow civilizations in which the final vital force was flickering out in\nbrilliant fireworks of wit and depravity. At the commencement, the noble caste\nwas always the barbarian caste: their superiority did not consist first of all\nin their physical, but in their psychical power\u2014they were more COMPLETE men\n(which at every point also implies the same as \"more complete beasts\").\n\n258\\. Corruption\u2014as the indication that anarchy threatens to break out among\nthe instincts, and that the foundation of the emotions, called \"life,\" is\nconvulsed\u2014is something radically different according to the organization in\nwhich it manifests itself. When, for instance, an aristocracy like that of\nFrance at the beginning of the Revolution, flung away its privileges with\nsublime disgust and sacrificed itself to an excess of its moral sentiments, it\nwas corruption:\u2014it was really only the closing act of the corruption which had\nexisted for centuries, by virtue of which that aristocracy had abdicated step\nby step its lordly prerogatives and lowered itself to a FUNCTION of royalty\n(in the end even to its decoration and parade-dress). The essential thing,\nhowever, in a good and healthy aristocracy is that it should not regard itself\nas a function either of the kingship or the commonwealth, but as the\nSIGNIFICANCE and highest justification thereof\u2014that it should therefore accept\nwith a good conscience the sacrifice of a legion of individuals, who, FOR ITS\nSAKE, must be suppressed and reduced to imperfect men, to slaves and\ninstruments. Its fundamental belief must be precisely that society is NOT\nallowed to exist for its own sake, but only as a foundation and scaffolding,\nby means of which a select class of beings may be able to elevate themselves\nto their higher duties, and in general to a higher EXISTENCE: like those sun-\nseeking climbing plants in Java\u2014they are called Sipo Matador,\u2014which encircle\nan oak so long and so often with their arms, until at last, high above it, but\nsupported by it, they can unfold their tops in the open light, and exhibit\ntheir happiness.\n\n259\\. To refrain mutually from injury, from violence, from exploitation, and\nput one's will on a par with that of others: this may result in a certain\nrough sense in good conduct among individuals when the necessary conditions\nare given (namely, the actual similarity of the individuals in amount of force\nand degree of worth, and their co-relation within one organization). As soon,\nhowever, as one wished to take this principle more generally, and if possible\neven as the FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF SOCIETY, it would immediately disclose\nwhat it really is\u2014namely, a Will to the DENIAL of life, a principle of\ndissolution and decay. Here one must think profoundly to the very basis and\nresist all sentimental weakness: life itself is ESSENTIALLY appropriation,\ninjury, conquest of the strange and weak, suppression, severity, obtrusion of\npeculiar forms, incorporation, and at the least, putting it mildest,\nexploitation;\u2014but why should one for ever use precisely these words on which\nfor ages a disparaging purpose has been stamped?

In a tour through the many finer and coarser moralities which have\nhitherto prevailed or still prevail on the earth, I found certain traits\nrecurring regularly together, and connected with one another, until finally\ntwo primary types revealed themselves to me, and a radical distinction was\nbrought to light. There is MASTER-MORALITY and SLAVE-MORALITY,\u2014I would at once\nadd, however, that in all higher and mixed civilizations, there are also\nattempts at the reconciliation of the two moralities, but one finds still\noftener the confusion and mutual misunderstanding of them, indeed sometimes\ntheir close juxtaposition\u2014even in the same man, within one soul. The\ndistinctions of moral values have either originated in a ruling caste,\npleasantly conscious of being different from the ruled\u2014or among the ruled\nclass, the slaves and dependents of all sorts. In the first case, when it is\nthe rulers who determine the conception \"good,\" it is the exalted, proud\ndisposition which is regarded as the distinguishing feature, and that which\ndetermines the order of rank. The noble type of man separates from himself the\nbeings in whom the opposite of this exalted, proud disposition displays itself\nhe despises them. Let it at once be noted that in this first kind of morality\nthe antithesis \"good\" and \"bad\" means practically the same as \"noble\" and\n\"despicable\",\u2014the antithesis \"good\" and \"EVIL\" is of a different origin. The\ncowardly, the timid, the insignificant, and those thinking merely of narrow\nutility are despised; moreover, also, the distrustful, with their constrained\nglances, the self-abasing, the dog-like kind of men who let themselves be\nabused, the mendicant flatterers, and above all the liars:\u2014it is a fundamental\nbelief of all aristocrats that the common people are untruthful. \"We truthful\nones\"\u2014the nobility in ancient Greece called themselves. It is obvious that\neverywhere the designations of moral value were at first applied to MEN; and\nwere only derivatively and at a later period applied to ACTIONS; it is a gross\nmistake, therefore, when historians of morals start with questions like, \"Why\nhave sympathetic actions been praised?\" The noble type of man regards HIMSELF\nas a determiner of values; he does not require to be approved of; he passes\nthe judgment: \"What is injurious to me is injurious in itself;\" he knows that\nit is he himself only who confers honour on things; he is a CREATOR OF VALUES.\nHe honours whatever he recognizes in himself: such morality equals self-\nglorification. In the foreground there is the feeling of plenitude, of power,\nwhich seeks to overflow, the happiness of high tension, the consciousness of a\nwealth which would fain give and bestow:\u2014the noble man also helps the\nunfortunate, but not\u2014or scarcely\u2014out of pity, but rather from an impulse\ngenerated by the super-abundance of power.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 322124, "end_char_idx": 326291, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8fb692bd-30ac-400a-9119-68de3233c2bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "8fb692bd-30ac-400a-9119-68de3233c2bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9e1d2bf9-0587-4351-bf72-11d6b69e30c3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ff3048a679e97591cced124b82896a938ca8945069b5eb3931424fb508495fe1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a16bd2ce-b6b0-4973-b47a-d21e23a355e3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "134a9f8c52a1c8396dc8371c4c6f06806701340f67c99991229885ed28b54fcb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b00bc343-d27d-438b-97a0-a0f677440fe7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0edd98c490c9f0cab15352bf771f9f9063736f4dd65703a0e6b8f3c8c6f04e4d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The noble type of man regards HIMSELF\nas a determiner of values; he does not require to be approved of; he passes\nthe judgment: \"What is injurious to me is injurious in itself;\" he knows that\nit is he himself only who confers honour on things; he is a CREATOR OF VALUES.\nHe honours whatever he recognizes in himself: such morality equals self-\nglorification.

The noble man honours in himself\nthe powerful one, him also who has power over himself, who knows how to speak\nand how to keep silence, who takes pleasure in subjecting himself to severity\nand hardness, and has reverence for all that is severe and hard. \"Wotan placed\na hard heart in my breast,\" says an old Scandinavian Saga: it is thus rightly\nexpressed from the soul of a proud Viking. Such a type of man is even proud of\nnot being made for sympathy; the hero of the Saga therefore adds warningly:\n\"He who has not a hard heart when young, will never have one.\" The noble and\nbrave who think thus are the furthest removed from the morality which sees\nprecisely in sympathy, or in acting for the good of others, or in\nDESINTERESSEMENT, the characteristic of the moral; faith in oneself, pride in\noneself, a radical enmity and irony towards \"selflessness,\" belong as\ndefinitely to noble morality, as do a careless scorn and precaution in\npresence of sympathy and the \"warm heart.\"\u2014It is the powerful who KNOW how to\nhonour, it is their art, their domain for invention. The profound reverence\nfor age and for tradition\u2014all law rests on this double reverence,\u2014the belief\nand prejudice in favour of ancestors and unfavourable to newcomers, is typical\nin the morality of the powerful; and if, reversely, men of \"modern ideas\"\nbelieve almost instinctively in \"progress\" and the \"future,\" and are more and\nmore lacking in respect for old age, the ignoble origin of these \"ideas\" has\ncomplacently betrayed itself thereby. A morality of the ruling class, however,\nis more especially foreign and irritating to present-day taste in the\nsternness of its principle that one has duties only to one's equals; that one\nmay act towards beings of a lower rank, towards all that is foreign, just as\nseems good to one, or \"as the heart desires,\" and in any case \"beyond good and\nevil\": it is here that sympathy and similar sentiments can have a place. The\nability and obligation to exercise prolonged gratitude and prolonged\nrevenge\u2014both only within the circle of equals,\u2014artfulness in retaliation,\nRAFFINEMENT of the idea in friendship, a certain necessity to have enemies (as\noutlets for the emotions of envy, quarrelsomeness, arrogance\u2014in fact, in order\nto be a good FRIEND): all these are typical characteristics of the noble\nmorality, which, as has been pointed out, is not the morality of \"modern\nideas,\" and is therefore at present difficult to realize, and also to unearth\nand disclose.\u2014It is otherwise with the second type of morality, SLAVE-\nMORALITY. Supposing that the abused, the oppressed, the suffering, the\nunemancipated, the weary, and those uncertain of themselves should moralize,\nwhat will be the common element in their moral estimates? Probably a\npessimistic suspicion with regard to the entire situation of man will find\nexpression, perhaps a condemnation of man, together with his situation. The\nslave has an unfavourable eye for the virtues of the powerful; he has a\nskepticism and distrust, a REFINEMENT of distrust of everything \"good\" that is\nthere honoured\u2014he would fain persuade himself that the very happiness there is\nnot genuine. On the other hand, THOSE qualities which serve to alleviate the\nexistence of sufferers are brought into prominence and flooded with light; it\nis here that sympathy, the kind, helping hand, the warm heart, patience,\ndiligence, humility, and friendliness attain to honour; for here these are the\nmost useful qualities, and almost the only means of supporting the burden of\nexistence.

Slave-morality is essentially the morality of utility. Here is the\nseat of the origin of the famous antithesis \"good\" and \"evil\":\u2014power and\ndangerousness are assumed to reside in the evil, a certain dreadfulness,\nsubtlety, and strength, which do not admit of being despised. According to\nslave-morality, therefore, the \"evil\" man arouses fear; according to master-\nmorality, it is precisely the \"good\" man who arouses fear and seeks to arouse\nit, while the bad man is regarded as the despicable being. The contrast\nattains its maximum when, in accordance with the logical consequences of\nslave-morality, a shade of depreciation\u2014it may be slight and well-\nintentioned\u2014at last attaches itself to the \"good\" man of this morality;\nbecause, according to the servile mode of thought, the good man must in any\ncase be the SAFE man: he is good-natured, easily deceived, perhaps a little\nstupid, un bonhomme. Everywhere that slave-morality gains the ascendancy,\nlanguage shows a tendency to approximate the significations of the words\n\"good\" and \"stupid.\"\u2014A last fundamental difference: the desire for FREEDOM,\nthe instinct for happiness and the refinements of the feeling of liberty\nbelong as necessarily to slave-morals and morality, as artifice and enthusiasm\nin reverence and devotion are the regular symptoms of an aristocratic mode of\nthinking and estimating.\u2014Hence we can understand without further detail why\nlove AS A PASSION\u2014it is our European specialty\u2014must absolutely be of noble\norigin; as is well known, its invention is due to the Provencal poet-\ncavaliers, those brilliant, ingenious men of the \"gai saber,\" to whom Europe\nowes so much, and almost owes itself.\n\n261\\. Vanity is one of the things which are perhaps most difficult for a noble\nman to understand: he will be tempted to deny it, where another kind of man\nthinks he sees it self-evidently. The problem for him is to represent to his\nmind beings who seek to arouse a good opinion of themselves which they\nthemselves do not possess\u2014and consequently also do not \"deserve,\"\u2014and who yet\nBELIEVE in this good opinion afterwards. This seems to him on the one hand\nsuch bad taste and so self-disrespectful, and on the other hand so grotesquely\nunreasonable, that he would like to consider vanity an exception, and is\ndoubtful about it in most cases when it is spoken of. He will say, for\ninstance: \"I may be mistaken about my value, and on the other hand may\nnevertheless demand that my value should be acknowledged by others precisely\nas I rate it:\u2014that, however, is not vanity (but self-conceit, or, in most\ncases, that which is called 'humility,' and also 'modesty').\" Or he will even\nsay: \"For many reasons I can delight in the good opinion of others, perhaps\nbecause I love and honour them, and rejoice in all their joys, perhaps also\nbecause their good opinion endorses and strengthens my belief in my own good\nopinion, perhaps because the good opinion of others, even in cases where I do\nnot share it, is useful to me, or gives promise of usefulness:\u2014all this,\nhowever, is not vanity.\"", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 329031, "end_char_idx": 332870, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8995e651-cf02-4732-bb69-c020eb75862b": {"__data__": {"id_": "8995e651-cf02-4732-bb69-c020eb75862b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9e1d2bf9-0587-4351-bf72-11d6b69e30c3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ff3048a679e97591cced124b82896a938ca8945069b5eb3931424fb508495fe1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b00bc343-d27d-438b-97a0-a0f677440fe7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "d1d7187cbdb6221391a2f71974baf5fedd6eb0e0016a590ec7547b8d7fee8890", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1a9d57ae-cb2d-4098-84ab-04e4411609fd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "300804a8adc8b041ef43af2271d42ae3d0391def33addddc3e5ff7fa09804748", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "He will say, for\ninstance: \"I may be mistaken about my value, and on the other hand may\nnevertheless demand that my value should be acknowledged by others precisely\nas I rate it:\u2014that, however, is not vanity (but self-conceit, or, in most\ncases, that which is called 'humility,' and also 'modesty').\" Or he will even\nsay: \"For many reasons I can delight in the good opinion of others, perhaps\nbecause I love and honour them, and rejoice in all their joys, perhaps also\nbecause their good opinion endorses and strengthens my belief in my own good\nopinion, perhaps because the good opinion of others, even in cases where I do\nnot share it, is useful to me, or gives promise of usefulness:\u2014all this,\nhowever, is not vanity.\" The man of noble character must first bring it home\nforcibly to his mind, especially with the aid of history, that, from time\nimmemorial, in all social strata in any way dependent, the ordinary man WAS\nonly that which he PASSED FOR:\u2014not being at all accustomed to fix values, he\ndid not assign even to himself any other value than that which his master\nassigned to him (it is the peculiar RIGHT OF MASTERS to create values). It may\nbe looked upon as the result of an extraordinary atavism, that the ordinary\nman, even at present, is still always WAITING for an opinion about himself,\nand then instinctively submitting himself to it; yet by no means only to a\n\"good\" opinion, but also to a bad and unjust one (think, for instance, of the\ngreater part of the self-appreciations and self-depreciations which believing\nwomen learn from their confessors, and which in general the believing\nChristian learns from his Church). In fact, conformably to the slow rise of\nthe democratic social order (and its cause, the blending of the blood of\nmasters and slaves), the originally noble and rare impulse of the masters to\nassign a value to themselves and to \"think well\" of themselves, will now be\nmore and more encouraged and extended; but it has at all times an older,\nampler, and more radically ingrained propensity opposed to it\u2014and in the\nphenomenon of \"vanity\" this older propensity overmasters the younger. The vain\nperson rejoices over EVERY good opinion which he hears about himself (quite\napart from the point of view of its usefulness, and equally regardless of its\ntruth or falsehood), just as he suffers from every bad opinion: for he\nsubjects himself to both, he feels himself subjected to both, by that oldest\ninstinct of subjection which breaks forth in him.\u2014It is \"the slave\" in the\nvain man's blood, the remains of the slave's craftiness\u2014and how much of the\n\"slave\" is still left in woman, for instance!\u2014which seeks to SEDUCE to good\nopinions of itself; it is the slave, too, who immediately afterwards falls\nprostrate himself before these opinions, as though he had not called them\nforth.\u2014And to repeat it again: vanity is an atavism.\n\n262\\. A SPECIES originates, and a type becomes established and strong in the\nlong struggle with essentially constant UNFAVOURABLE conditions.

The most\nvaried experience teaches it what are the qualities to which it principally\nowes the fact that it still exists, in spite of all Gods and men, and has\nhitherto been victorious: these qualities it calls virtues, and these virtues\nalone it develops to maturity. It does so with severity, indeed it desires\nseverity; every aristocratic morality is intolerant in the education of youth,\nin the control of women, in the marriage customs, in the relations of old and\nyoung, in the penal laws (which have an eye only for the degenerating): it\ncounts intolerance itself among the virtues, under the name of \"justice.\" A\ntype with few, but very marked features, a species of severe, warlike, wisely\nsilent, reserved, and reticent men (and as such, with the most delicate\nsensibility for the charm and nuances of society) is thus established,\nunaffected by the vicissitudes of generations; the constant struggle with\nuniform UNFAVOURABLE conditions is, as already remarked, the cause of a type\nbecoming stable and hard.

Variations, whether they be deviations (into the higher,\nfiner, and rarer), or deteriorations and monstrosities, appear suddenly on the\nscene in the greatest exuberance and splendour; the individual dares to be\nindividual and detach himself. At this turning-point of history there manifest\nthemselves, side by side, and often mixed and entangled together, a\nmagnificent, manifold, virgin-forest-like up-growth and up-striving, a kind of\nTROPICAL TEMPO in the rivalry of growth, and an extraordinary decay and self-\ndestruction, owing to the savagely opposing and seemingly exploding egoisms,\nwhich strive with one another \"for sun and light,\" and can no longer assign\nany limit, restraint, or forbearance for themselves by means of the hitherto\nexisting morality. It was this morality itself which piled up the strength so\nenormously, which bent the bow in so threatening a manner:\u2014it is now \"out of\ndate,\" it is getting \"out of date.\" The dangerous and disquieting point has\nbeen reached when the greater, more manifold, more comprehensive life IS LIVED\nBEYOND the old morality; the \"individual\" stands out, and is obliged to have\nrecourse to his own law-giving, his own arts and artifices for self-\npreservation, self-elevation, and self-deliverance. Nothing but new \"Whys,\"\nnothing but new \"Hows,\" no common formulas any longer, misunderstanding and\ndisregard in league with each other, decay, deterioration, and the loftiest\ndesires frightfully entangled, the genius of the race overflowing from all the\ncornucopias of good and bad, a portentous simultaneousness of Spring and\nAutumn, full of new charms and mysteries peculiar to the fresh, still\ninexhausted, still unwearied corruption.

There is an INSTINCT FOR RANK, which more than anything else is already\nthe sign of a HIGH rank; there is a DELIGHT in the NUANCES of reverence which\nleads one to infer noble origin and habits. The refinement, goodness, and\nloftiness of a soul are put to a perilous test when something passes by that\nis of the highest rank, but is not yet protected by the awe of authority from\nobtrusive touches and incivilities: something that goes its way like a living\ntouchstone, undistinguished, undiscovered, and tentative, perhaps voluntarily\nveiled and disguised. He whose task and practice it is to investigate souls,\nwill avail himself of many varieties of this very art to determine the\nultimate value of a soul, the unalterable, innate order of rank to which it\nbelongs: he will test it by its INSTINCT FOR REVERENCE. DIFFERENCE ENGENDRE\nHAINE: the vulgarity of many a nature spurts up suddenly like dirty water,\nwhen any holy vessel, any jewel from closed shrines, any book bearing the\nmarks of great destiny, is brought before it; while on the other hand, there\nis an involuntary silence, a hesitation of the eye, a cessation of all\ngestures, by which it is indicated that a soul FEELS the nearness of what is\nworthiest of respect. The way in which, on the whole, the reverence for the\nBIBLE has hitherto been maintained in Europe, is perhaps the best example of\ndiscipline and refinement of manners which Europe owes to Christianity: books\nof such profoundness and supreme significance require for their protection an\nexternal tyranny of authority, in order to acquire the PERIOD of thousands of\nyears which is necessary to exhaust and unriddle them. Much has been achieved\nwhen the sentiment has been at last instilled into the masses (the shallow-\npates and the boobies of every kind) that they are not allowed to touch\neverything, that there are holy experiences before which they must take off\ntheir shoes and keep away the unclean hand\u2014it is almost their highest advance\ntowards humanity.

It cannot be effaced from a man's soul what his ancestors have\npreferably and most constantly done: whether they were perhaps diligent\neconomizers attached to a desk and a cash-box, modest and citizen-like in\ntheir desires, modest also in their virtues; or whether they were accustomed\nto commanding from morning till night, fond of rude pleasures and probably of\nstill ruder duties and responsibilities; or whether, finally, at one time or\nanother, they have sacrificed old privileges of birth and possession, in order\nto live wholly for their faith\u2014for their \"God,\"\u2014as men of an inexorable and\nsensitive conscience, which blushes at every compromise. It is quite\nimpossible for a man NOT to have the qualities and predilections of his\nparents and ancestors in his constitution, whatever appearances may suggest to\nthe contrary. This is the problem of race. Granted that one knows something of\nthe parents, it is admissible to draw a conclusion about the child: any kind\nof offensive incontinence, any kind of sordid envy, or of clumsy self-\nvaunting\u2014the three things which together have constituted the genuine plebeian\ntype in all times\u2014such must pass over to the child, as surely as bad blood;\nand with the help of the best education and culture one will only succeed in\nDECEIVING with regard to such heredity.\u2014And what else does education and\nculture try to do nowadays! In our very democratic, or rather, very plebeian\nage, \"education\" and \"culture\" MUST be essentially the art of\ndeceiving\u2014deceiving with regard to origin, with regard to the inherited\nplebeianism in body and soul. An educator who nowadays preached truthfulness\nabove everything else, and called out constantly to his pupils: \"Be true! Be\nnatural! Show yourselves as you are!\"\u2014even such a virtuous and sincere ass\nwould learn in a short time to have recourse to the FURCA of Horace, NATURAM\nEXPELLERE: with what results? \"Plebeianism\" USQUE RECURRET.

At the risk of displeasing innocent ears, I submit that egoism belongs\nto the essence of a noble soul, I mean the unalterable belief that to a being\nsuch as \"we,\" other beings must naturally be in subjection, and have to\nsacrifice themselves. The noble soul accepts the fact of his egoism without\nquestion, and also without consciousness of harshness, constraint, or\narbitrariness therein, but rather as something that may have its basis in the\nprimary law of things:\u2014if he sought a designation for it he would say: \"It is\njustice itself.\" He acknowledges under certain circumstances, which made him\nhesitate at first, that there are other equally privileged ones; as soon as he\nhas settled this question of rank, he moves among those equals and equally\nprivileged ones with the same assurance, as regards modesty and delicate\nrespect, which he enjoys in intercourse with himself\u2014in accordance with an\ninnate heavenly mechanism which all the stars understand. It is an ADDITIONAL\ninstance of his egoism, this artfulness and self-limitation in intercourse\nwith his equals\u2014every star is a similar egoist; he honours HIMSELF in them,\nand in the rights which he concedes to them, he has no doubt that the exchange\nof honours and rights, as the ESSENCE of all intercourse, belongs also to the\nnatural condition of things.

The notion of \"favour\" has, INTER PARES, neither significance nor good\nrepute; there may be a sublime way of letting gifts as it were light upon one\nfrom above, and of drinking them thirstily like dew-drops; but for those arts\nand displays the noble soul has no aptitude.

What, after all, is ignobleness?\u2014Words are vocal symbols for ideas;\nideas, however, are more or less definite mental symbols for frequently\nreturning and concurring sensations, for groups of sensations. It is not\nsufficient to use the same words in order to understand one another: we must\nalso employ the same words for the same kind of internal experiences, we must\nin the end have experiences IN COMMON. On this account the people of one\nnation understand one another better than those belonging to different\nnations, even when they use the same language; or rather, when people have\nlived long together under similar conditions (of climate, soil, danger,\nrequirement, toil) there ORIGINATES therefrom an entity that \"understands\nitself\"\u2014namely, a nation. In all souls a like number of frequently recurring\nexperiences have gained the upper hand over those occurring more rarely: about\nthese matters people understand one another rapidly and always more\nrapidly\u2014the history of language is the history of a process of abbreviation;\non the basis of this quick comprehension people always unite closer and\ncloser. The greater the danger, the greater is the need of agreeing quickly\nand readily about what is necessary; not to misunderstand one another in\ndanger\u2014that is what cannot at all be dispensed with in intercourse. Also in\nall loves and friendships one has the experience that nothing of the kind\ncontinues when the discovery has been made that in using the same words, one\nof the two parties has feelings, thoughts, intuitions, wishes, or fears\ndifferent from those of the other. (The fear of the \"eternal\nmisunderstanding\": that is the good genius which so often keeps persons of\ndifferent sexes from too hasty attachments, to which sense and heart prompt\nthem\u2014and NOT some Schopenhauerian \"genius of the species\"!) Whichever groups\nof sensations within a soul awaken most readily, begin to speak, and give the\nword of command\u2014these decide as to the general order of rank of its values,\nand determine ultimately its list of desirable things. A man's estimates of\nvalue betray something of the STRUCTURE of his soul, and wherein it sees its\nconditions of life, its intrinsic needs. Supposing now that necessity has from\nall time drawn together only such men as could express similar requirements\nand similar experiences by similar symbols, it results on the whole that the\neasy COMMUNICABILITY of need, which implies ultimately the undergoing only of\naverage and COMMON experiences, must have been the most potent of all the\nforces which have hitherto operated upon mankind.

What does the word \"noble\" still mean for us nowadays?\nHow does the noble man betray himself, how is he recognized under this heavy\novercast sky of the commencing plebeianism, by which everything is rendered\nopaque and leaden?\u2014It is not his actions which establish his claim\u2014actions are\nalways ambiguous, always inscrutable; neither is it his \"works.\" One finds\nnowadays among artists and scholars plenty of those who betray by their works\nthat a profound longing for nobleness impels them; but this very NEED of\nnobleness is radically different from the needs of the noble soul itself, and\nis in fact the eloquent and dangerous sign of the lack thereof. It is not the\nworks, but the BELIEF which is here decisive and determines the order of\nrank\u2014to employ once more an old religious formula with a new and deeper\nmeaning\u2014it is some fundamental certainty which a noble soul has about itself,\nsomething which is not to be sought, is not to be found, and perhaps, also, is\nnot to be lost.\u2014THE NOBLE SOUL HAS REVERENCE FOR ITSELF.\u2014\n\n288\\.

In the writings of a recluse one always hears something of the echo of\nthe wilderness, something of the murmuring tones and timid vigilance of\nsolitude; in his strongest words, even in his cry itself, there sounds a new\nand more dangerous kind of silence, of concealment. He who has sat day and\nnight, from year's end to year's end, alone with his soul in familiar discord\nand discourse, he who has become a cave-bear, or a treasure-seeker, or a\ntreasure-guardian and dragon in his cave\u2014it may be a labyrinth, but can also\nbe a gold-mine\u2014his ideas themselves eventually acquire a twilight-colour of\ntheir own, and an odour, as much of the depth as of the mould, something\nuncommunicative and repulsive, which blows chilly upon every passer-by. The\nrecluse does not believe that a philosopher\u2014supposing that a philosopher has\nalways in the first place been a recluse\u2014ever expressed his actual and\nultimate opinions in books: are not books written precisely to hide what is in\nus?\u2014indeed, he will doubt whether a philosopher CAN have \"ultimate and actual\"\nopinions at all; whether behind every cave in him there is not, and must\nnecessarily be, a still deeper cave: an ampler, stranger, richer world beyond\nthe surface, an abyss behind every bottom, beneath every \"foundation.\" Every\nphilosophy is a foreground philosophy\u2014this is a recluse's verdict: \"There is\nsomething arbitrary in the fact that the PHILOSOPHER came to a stand here,\ntook a retrospect, and looked around; that he HERE laid his spade aside and\ndid not dig any deeper\u2014there is also something suspicious in it.\" Every\nphilosophy also CONCEALS a philosophy; every opinion is also a LURKING-PLACE,\nevery word is also a MASK.\n\n290\\. Every deep thinker is more afraid of being understood than of being\nmisunderstood. The latter perhaps wounds his vanity; but the former wounds his\nheart, his sympathy, which always says: \"Ah, why would you also have as hard a\ntime of it as I have?\"\n\n291\\. Man, a COMPLEX, mendacious, artful, and inscrutable animal, uncanny to\nthe other animals by his artifice and sagacity, rather than by his strength,\nhas invented the good conscience in order finally to enjoy his soul as\nsomething SIMPLE; and the whole of morality is a long, audacious\nfalsification, by virtue of which generally enjoyment at the sight of the soul\nbecomes possible. From this point of view there is perhaps much more in the\nconception of \"art\" than is generally believed.\n\n292\\. A philosopher: that is a man who constantly experiences, sees, hears,\nsuspects, hopes, and dreams extraordinary things; who is struck by his own\nthoughts as if they came from the outside, from above and below, as a species\nof events and lightning-flashes PECULIAR TO HIM; who is perhaps himself a\nstorm pregnant with new lightnings; a portentous man, around whom there is\nalways rumbling and mumbling and gaping and something uncanny going on. A\nphilosopher: alas, a being who often runs away from himself, is often afraid\nof himself\u2014but whose curiosity always makes him \"come to himself\" again.\n\n293\\. A man who says: \"I like that, I take it for my own, and mean to guard\nand protect it from every one\"; a man who can conduct a case, carry out a\nresolution, remain true to an opinion, keep hold of a woman, punish and\noverthrow insolence; a man who has his indignation and his sword, and to whom\nthe weak, the suffering, the oppressed, and even the animals willingly submit\nand naturally belong; in short, a man who is a MASTER by nature\u2014when such a\nman has sympathy, well!

The very fact that\nDionysus is a philosopher, and that therefore Gods also philosophize, seems to\nme a novelty which is not unensnaring, and might perhaps arouse suspicion\nprecisely among philosophers;\u2014among you, my friends, there is less to be said\nagainst it, except that it comes too late and not at the right time; for, as\nit has been disclosed to me, you are loth nowadays to believe in God and gods.\nIt may happen, too, that in the frankness of my story I must go further than\nis agreeable to the strict usages of your ears? Certainly the God in question\nwent further, very much further, in such dialogues, and was always many paces\nahead of me... Indeed, if it were allowed, I should have to give him,\naccording to human usage, fine ceremonious tides of lustre and merit, I should\nhave to extol his courage as investigator and discoverer, his fearless\nhonesty, truthfulness, and love of wisdom. But such a God does not know what\nto do with all that respectable trumpery and pomp. \"Keep that,\" he would say,\n\"for thyself and those like thee, and whoever else require it! I\u2014have no\nreason to cover my nakedness!\" One suspects that this kind of divinity and\nphilosopher perhaps lacks shame?\u2014He once said: \"Under certain circumstances I\nlove mankind\"\u2014and referred thereby to Ariadne, who was present; \"in my opinion\nman is an agreeable, brave, inventive animal, that has not his equal upon\nearth, he makes his way even through all labyrinths. I like man, and often\nthink how I can still further advance him, and make him stronger, more evil,\nand more profound.\"\u2014\"Stronger, more evil, and more profound?\" I asked in\nhorror. \"Yes,\" he said again, \"stronger, more evil, and more profound; also\nmore beautiful\"\u2014and thereby the tempter-god smiled with his halcyon smile, as\nthough he had just paid some charming compliment. One here sees at once that\nit is not only shame that this divinity lacks;\u2014and in general there are good\ngrounds for supposing that in some things the Gods could all of them come to\nus men for instruction. We men are\u2014more human.\u2014\n\n296\\. Alas! what are you, after all, my written and painted thoughts!

A. Magnus\n\n1\\.  \n  \nMIDDAY of Life! Oh, season of delight!  \nMy summer's park!  \nUneaseful joy to look, to lurk, to hark\u2014  \nI peer for friends, am ready day and night,\u2014  \nWhere linger ye, my friends? The time is right!  \n  \n2\\.  \n  \nIs not the glacier's grey today for you  \nRose-garlanded?  \nThe brooklet seeks you, wind, cloud, with longing thread  \nAnd thrust themselves yet higher to the blue,  \nTo spy for you from farthest eagle's view.  \n  \n3\\.  \n  \nMy table was spread out for you on high\u2014  \nWho dwelleth so  \nStar-near, so near the grisly pit below?\u2014  \nMy realm\u2014what realm hath wider boundary?  \nMy honey\u2014who hath sipped its fragrancy?  \n  \n4\\.  \n  \nFriends, ye are there! Woe me,\u2014yet I am not  \nHe whom ye seek?  \nYe stare and stop\u2014better your wrath could speak!  \nI am not I? Hand, gait, face, changed? And what  \nI am, to you my friends, now am I not?  \n  \n5\\.  \n  \nAm I an other? Strange am I to Me?  \nYet from Me sprung?  \nA wrestler, by himself too oft self-wrung?  \nHindering too oft my own self's potency,  \nWounded and hampered by self-victory?  \n  \n6\\.  \n  \nI sought where-so the wind blows keenest. There  \nI learned to dwell  \nWhere no man dwells, on lonesome ice-lorn fell,  \nAnd unlearned Man and God and curse and prayer?  \nBecame a ghost haunting the glaciers bare?  \n  \n7\\.  \n  \nYe, my old friends! Look! Ye turn pale, filled o'er  \nWith love and fear!  \nGo! Yet not in wrath. Ye could ne'er live here.  \nHere in the farthest realm of ice and scaur,  \nA huntsman must one be, like chamois soar.  \n  \n8\\.  \n  \nAn evil huntsman was I? See how taut  \nMy bow was bent!  \nStrongest was he by whom such bolt were sent\u2014  \nWoe now! That arrow is with peril fraught,  \nPerilous as none.\u2014Have yon safe home ye sought!  \n  \n9\\.  \n  \nYe go! Thou didst endure enough, oh, heart;\u2014  \nStrong was thy hope;  \nUnto new friends thy portals widely ope,  \nLet old ones be. Bid memory depart!  \nWast thou young then, now\u2014better young thou art!  \n  \n10\\.  \n  \nWhat linked us once together, one hope's tie\u2014  \n(Who now doth con  \nThose lines, now fading, Love once wrote thereon?)\u2014  \nIs like a parchment, which the hand is shy  \nTo touch\u2014like crackling leaves, all seared, all dry.  \n  \n11\\.  \n  \nOh! Friends no more! They are\u2014what name for those?\u2014  \nFriends' phantom-flight  \nKnocking at my heart's window-pane at night,  \nGazing on me, that speaks \"We were\" and goes,\u2014  \nOh, withered words, once fragrant as the rose!  \n  \n12\\.  \n  \nPinings of youth that might not understand!  \nFor which I pined,  \nWhich I deemed changed with me, kin of my kind:  \nBut they grew old, and thus were doomed and banned:  \nNone but new kith are native of my land!  \n  \n13\\.  \n  \nMidday of life! My second youth's delight!  \nMy summer's park!  \nUnrestful joy to long, to lurk, to hark!  \nI peer for friends!\u2014am ready day and night,  \nFor my new friends. Come! Come! The time is right!  \n  \n14\\.  \n  \nThis song is done,\u2014the sweet sad cry of rue  \nSang out its end;  \nA wizard wrought it, he the timely friend,  \nThe midday-friend,\u2014no, do not ask me who;  \nAt midday 'twas, when one became as two.  \n  \n15\\.  \n  \nWe keep our Feast of Feasts, sure of our bourne,  \nOur aims self-same:  \nThe Guest of Guests, friend Zarathustra, came!  \nThe world now laughs, the grisly veil was torn,  \nAnd Light and Dark were one that wedding-morn.  \n\n  \n  \n\n* * *", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 378867, "end_char_idx": 382987, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5639d709-f95a-46dd-be1f-293fc8e9fc19": {"__data__": {"id_": "5639d709-f95a-46dd-be1f-293fc8e9fc19", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9e1d2bf9-0587-4351-bf72-11d6b69e30c3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ff3048a679e97591cced124b82896a938ca8945069b5eb3931424fb508495fe1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f87db821-3d57-4255-acb8-d5437f098206", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/beyond/beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_name": "beyond_good_and_evil.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 246490, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "cc1f85fcda362f0c31116892e27fb6649d2cf0ef279de6b3892acadbc678bd98", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "92f517fa-8b4b-49b7-9175-ca99208bde0a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4d99b179be1f2fb8f7eb37f084b38675e48b742daf36339a51451bfc4472326f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL ***\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\u2014the old editions will be\nrenamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright law\nmeans that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the\nFoundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public\nsupport and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of\npublic domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-\nreadable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated\nequipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to\nmaintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities\nand charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance\nrequirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much\npaperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not\nsolicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation\nof compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit\n[www.gutenberg.org/donate](https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/).\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not\nmet the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting\nunsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers\nto donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the\nUnited States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and\naddresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks,\nonline payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit:\nwww.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg\u2122 concept\nof a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For\nforty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a\nloose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all\nof which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a\ncopyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in\ncompliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search facility:\n[www.gutenberg.org](https://www.gutenberg.org).\n\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122, including how to\nmake donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to\nhelp produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to\nhear about new eBooks.\n\n\n![Cover](4283233339086455894_4363-cover.png)", "mimetype":
