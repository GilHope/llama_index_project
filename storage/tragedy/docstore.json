In 1841, at the time when our father was tutor to the\nAltenburg Princesses, Theresa of Saxe-Altenburg, Elizabeth, Grand Duchess of\nOlden-burg, and Alexandra, Grand Duchess Constantine of Russia, he had had the\nhonour of being presented to his witty and pious sovereign. The meeting seems\nto have impressed both parties very favourably; for, very shortly after it had\ntaken place, our father received his living at R\u00f6cken \"by supreme command.\"\nHis joy may well be imagined, therefore, when a first son was born to him on\nhis beloved and august patron's birthday, and at the christening ceremony he\nspoke as follows:\u2014\"Thou blessed month of October!\u2014for many years the most\ndecisive events in my life have occurred within thy thirty-one days, and now I\ncelebrate the greatest and most glorious of them all by baptising my little\nboy!

Our mother, who was the daughter of a clergyman, was\ngood-looking and healthy, and was one of a very large family of sons and\ndaughters. Our paternal grandparents, the Rev. Oehler and his wife, in Pobles,\nwere typically healthy people. Strength, robustness, lively dispositions, and\na cheerful outlook on life, were among the qualities which every one was\npleased to observe in them. Our grandfather Oehler was a bright, clever man,\nand quite the old style of comfortable country parson, who thought it no sin\nto go hunting. He scarcely had a day's illness in his life, and would\ncertainly not have met with his end as early as he did\u2014that is to say, before\nhis seventieth year\u2014if his careless disregard of all caution, where his health\nwas concerned, had not led to his catching a severe and fatal cold. In regard\nto our grand-mother Oehler, who died in her eighty-second year, all that can\nbe said is, that if all German women were possessed of the health she enjoyed,\nthe German nation would excel all others from the standpoint of vitality. She\nbore our grandfather eleven children; gave each of them the breast for nearly\nthe whole of its first year, and reared them all It is said that the sight of\nthese eleven children, at ages varying from nineteen years to one month, with\ntheir powerful build, rosy cheeks, beaming eyes, and wealth of curly locks,\nprovoked the admiration of all visitors. Of course, despite their\nextraordinarily good health, the life of this family was not by any means all\nsunshine. Each of the children was very spirited, wilful, and obstinate, and\nit was therefore no simple matter to keep them in order. Moreover, though they\nalways showed the utmost respect and most implicit obedience to their\nparents\u2014even as middle-aged men and women\u2014misunderstandings between themselves\nwere of constant occurrence. Our Oehler grandparents were fairly well-to-do;\nfor our grandmother hailed from a very old family, who had been extensive\nland-owners in the neighbourhood of Zeitz for centuries, and her father owned\nthe baronial estate of Wehlitz and a magnificent seat near Zeitz in Pacht.\nWhen she married, her father gave her carriages and horses, a coachman, a\ncook, and a kitchenmaid, which for the wife of a German minister was then, and\nis still, something quite exceptional. As a result of the wars in the\nbeginning of the nineteenth century, however, our great-grandfather lost the\ngreater part of his property.\n\nOur father's family was also in fairly comfortable circumstances, and likewise\nvery large. Our grandfather Dr. Nietzsche (D.D. and Superintendent) married\ntwice, and had in all twelve children, of whom three died young. Our\ngrandfather on this side, whom I never knew, must certainly have been a\ndistinguished, dignified, very learned and reserved man; his second wife\u2014our\nbeloved grandmother\u2014was an active-minded, intelligent, and exceptionally good-\nnatured woman. The whole of our father's family, which I only got to know when\nthey were very advanced in years, were remarkable for their great power of\nself-control, their lively interest in intellectual matters, and a strong\nsense of family unity, which manifested itself both in their splendid\nreadiness to help one another and in their very excellent relations with each\nother.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2743, "end_char_idx": 6854, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7596d591-0f23-44e6-a65e-b978aaefc8c7": {"__data__": {"id_": "7596d591-0f23-44e6-a65e-b978aaefc8c7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11e7bbb4-f380-4d2a-b724-0bdf86b1b378", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "aeb08ac84a3c4636a7473de39f346a73d2a08999751ab3cf01bbab79f100626f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9afc747c-a3f4-41d4-b7a0-08de8023befc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "36b7913760dd4b3178ea9ba1f23919e4b1afc4ad5c1a7570dda203e456b93710", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dac479c3-a08f-4669-8c91-64b6ea86041c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d590af8e3210d626c814d2ee93312521e7c9756f10cc7c235cc52d0792468fa8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Our father's family was also in fairly comfortable circumstances, and likewise\nvery large.

Our father was the youngest son, and, thanks to his uncommonly lovable\ndisposition, together with other gifts, which only tended to become more\nmarked as he grew older, he was quite the favourite of the family. Blessed\nwith a thoroughly sound constitution, as all averred who knew him at the\nconvent-school in Rossleben, at the University, or later at the ducal court of\nAltenburg, he was tall and slender, possessed an undoubted gift for poetry and\nreal musical talent, and was moreover a man of delicate sensibilities, full of\nconsideration for his whole family, and distinguished in his manners.\n\nMy brother often refers to his Polish descent, and in later years he even\ninstituted research-work with the view of establishing it, which met with\npartial success. I know nothing definite concerning these investigations,\nbecause a large number of valuable documents were unfortunately destroyed\nafter his breakdown in Turin. The family tradition was that a certain Polish\nnobleman Nicki (pronounced Nietzky) had obtained the special favour of\nAugustus the Strong, King of Poland, and had received the rank of Earl from\nhim. When, however, Stanislas Leszcysski the Pole became king, our supposed\nancestor became involved in a conspiracy in favour of the Saxons and\nProtestants. He was sentenced to death; but, taking flight, according to the\nevidence of the documents, he was ultimately befriended by a certain Earl of\nBr\u00fchl, who gave him a small post in an obscure little provincial town.\nOccasionally our aged aunts would speak of our great-grandfather Nietzsche,\nwho was said to have died in his ninety-first year, and words always seemed to\nfail them when they attempted to describe his handsome appearance, good\nbreeding, and vigour. Our ancestors, both on the Nietzsche and the Oehler\nside, were very long-lived. Of the four pairs of great-grandparents, one\ngreat-grandfather reached the age of ninety, five great-grandmothers and-\nfathers died between eighty-two and eighty-six years of age, and two only\nfailed to reach their seventieth year.\n\nThe sorrow which hung as a cloud over our branch of the family was our\nfather's death, as the result of a heavy fall, at the age of thirty-eight. One\nnight, upon leaving some friends whom he had accompanied home, he was met at\nthe door of the vicarage by our little dog. The little animal must have got\nbetween his feet, for he stumbled and fell backwards down seven stone steps on\nto the paving-stones of the vicarage courtyard. As a result of this fall, he\nwas laid up with concussion of the brain, and, after a lingering illness,\nwhich lasted eleven months, he died on the 30th of July 1849. The early death\nof our beloved and highly-gifted father spread gloom over the whole of our\nchildhood. In 1850 our mother withdrew with us to Naumburg on the Saale, where\nshe took up her abode with our widowed grandmother Nietzsche; and there she\nbrought us up with Spartan severity and simplicity, which, besides being\ntypical of the period, was quite _de rigeur_ in her family. Of course, Grand-\nmamma Nietzsche helped somewhat to temper her daughter-in-law's severity, and\nin this respect our Oehler grandparents, who were less rigorous with us, their\neldest grandchildren, than with their own children, were also very\ninfluential.

Of course, Grand-\nmamma Nietzsche helped somewhat to temper her daughter-in-law's severity, and\nin this respect our Oehler grandparents, who were less rigorous with us, their\neldest grandchildren, than with their own children, were also very\ninfluential. Grandfather Oehler was the first who seems to have recognised the\nextraordinary talents of his eldest grandchild.\n\nFrom his earliest childhood upwards, my brother was always strong and healthy;\nhe often declared that he must have been taken for a peasant-boy throughout\nhis childhood and youth, as he was so plump, brown, and rosy. The thick fair\nhair which fell picturesquely over his shoulders tended somewhat to modify his\nrobust appearance. Had he not possessed those wonderfully beautiful, large,\nand expressive eyes, however, and had he not been so very ceremonious in his\nmanner, neither his teachers nor his relatives would ever have noticed\nanything at all remarkable about the boy; for he was both modest and reserved.\n\nHe received his early schooling at a preparatory school, and later at a\ngrammar school in Naumburg. In the autumn of 1858, when he was fourteen years\nof age, he entered the Pforta school, so famous for the scholars it has\nproduced. There, too, very severe discipline prevailed, and much was exacted\nfrom the pupils, with the view of inuring them to great mental and physical\nexertions. Thus, if my brother seems to lay particular stress upon the value\nof rigorous training, free from all sentimentality, it should be remembered\nthat he speaks from experience in this respect. At Pforta he followed the\nregular school course, and he did not enter a university until the\ncomparatively late age of twenty. His extraordinary gifts manifested\nthemselves chiefly in his independent and private studies and artistic\nefforts. As a boy his musical talent had already been so noticeable, that he\nhimself and other competent judges were doubtful as to whether he ought not\nperhaps to devote himself altogether to music. It is, however, worth noting\nthat everything he did in his later years, whether in Latin, Greek, or German\nwork, bore the stamp of perfection\u2014subject of course to the limitation imposed\nupon him by his years. His talents came very suddenly to the fore, because he\nhad allowed them to grow for such a long time in concealment. His very first\nperformance in philology, executed while he was a student under Ritschl, the\nfamous philologist, was also typical of him in this respect, seeing that it\nwas ordered to be printed for the _Rheinische Museum._ Of course this was done\namid general and grave expressions of doubt; for, as Dr. Ritschl often\ndeclared, it was an unheard-of occurrence for a student in his third term to\nprepare such an excellent treatise.\n\nBeing a great lover of out-door exercise, such as swimming, skating, and\nwalking, he developed into a very sturdy lad. Rohde gives the following\ndescription of him as a student: with his healthy complexion, his outward and\ninner cleanliness, his austere chastity and his solemn aspect, he was the\nimage of that delightful youth described by Adalbert Stifter.\n\nThough as a child he was always rather serious, as a lad and a man he was ever\ninclined to see the humorous side of things, while his whole being, and\neverything he said or did, was permeated by an extraordinary harmony. He\nbelonged to the very few who could control even a bad mood and conceal it from\nothers. All his friends are unanimous in their praise of his exceptional\nevenness of temper and behaviour, and his warm, hearty, and pleasant laugh\nthat seemed to come from the very depths of his benevolent and affectionate\nnature.

All his friends are unanimous in their praise of his exceptional\nevenness of temper and behaviour, and his warm, hearty, and pleasant laugh\nthat seemed to come from the very depths of his benevolent and affectionate\nnature. In him it might therefore be said, nature had produced a being who in\nbody and spirit was a harmonious whole: his unusual intellect was fully in\nkeeping with his uncommon bodily strength.\n\nThe only abnormal thing about him, and something which we both inherited from\nour father, was short-sightedness, and this was very much aggravated in my\nbrother's case, even in his earliest schooldays, owing to that indescribable\nanxiety to learn which always characterised him. When one listens to accounts\ngiven by his friends and schoolfellows, one is startled by the multiplicity of\nhis studies even in his schooldays.\n\nIn the autumn of 1864, he began his university life in Bonn, and studied\nphilology and theology; at the end of six months he gave up theology, and in\nthe autumn of 1865 followed his famous teacher Ritschl to the University of\nLeipzig. There he became an ardent philologist, and diligently sought to\nacquire a masterly grasp of this branch of knowledge. But in this respect it\nwould be unfair to forget that the school of Pforta, with its staff of\nexcellent teachers\u2014scholars that would have adorned the chairs of any\nUniversity\u2014had already afforded the best of preparatory trainings to any one\nintending to take up philology as a study, more particularly as it gave all\npupils ample scope to indulge any individual tastes they might have for any\nparticular branch of ancient history. The last important Latin thesis which my\nbrother wrote for the Landes-Schule, Pforta, dealt with the Megarian poet\nTheognis, and it was in the r\u00f4le of a lecturer on this very subject that, on\nthe 18th January 1866, he made his _first appearance in public_ before the\nphilological society he had helped to found in Leipzig. The paper he read\ndisclosed his investigations on the subject of Theognis the moralist and\naristocrat, who, as is well known, described and dismissed the plebeians of\nhis time in terms of the heartiest contempt The aristocratic ideal, which was\nalways so dear to my brother, thus revealed itself for the first time.\nMoreover, curiously enough, it was precisely _this_ scientific thesis which\nwas the cause of Ritschl's recognition of my brother and fondness for him.\n\nThe whole of his Leipzig days proved of the utmost importance to my brother's\ncareer. There he was plunged into the very midst of a torrent of intellectual\ninfluences which found an impressionable medium in the fiery youth, and to\nwhich he eagerly made himself accessible. He did not, however, forget to\ndiscriminate among them, but tested and criticised the currents of thought he\nencountered, and selected accordingly. It is certainly of great importance to\nascertain what those influences precisely were to which he yielded, and how\nlong they maintained their sway over him, and it is likewise necessary to\ndiscover exactly when the matured mind threw off these fetters in order to\nwork out its own salvation.\n\nThe influences that exercised power over him in those days may be described in\nthe three following terms: Hellenism, Schopenhauer, Wagner. His love of\nHellenism certainly led him to philology; but, as a matter of fact, what\nconcerned him most was to obtain a wide view of things in general, and this he\nhoped to derive from that science; philology in itself, with his splendid\nmethod and thorough way of going to work, served him only as a means to an\nend.\n\nIf Hellenism was the first strong influence which already in Pforta obtained a\nsway over my brother, in the winter of 1865-66, a completely new, and\ntherefore somewhat subversive, influence was introduced into his life with\nSchopenhauer's philosophy.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 12993, "end_char_idx": 17138, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "382e6fd5-fffe-4220-9452-533f6475407e": {"__data__": {"id_": "382e6fd5-fffe-4220-9452-533f6475407e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11e7bbb4-f380-4d2a-b724-0bdf86b1b378", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "aeb08ac84a3c4636a7473de39f346a73d2a08999751ab3cf01bbab79f100626f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "26c5fec7-5597-42f4-a3c6-973aa6772ee9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ff55ad18ada00f366eacb18b426cdf10eb4b4d2c4ee51640179fec3592a24db2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a11882f0-50ff-418a-9f2f-c07a6c7da5a2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c37965fed835ed02225cfcb047fa780e2493b4c9c284b3c0ec36982f198e2a7c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The influences that exercised power over him in those days may be described in\nthe three following terms: Hellenism, Schopenhauer, Wagner.

When he reached Leipzig in the autumn of 1865, he\nwas very downcast; for the experiences that had befallen him during his one\nyear of student life in Bonn had deeply depressed him. He had sought at first\nto adapt himself to his surroundings there, with the hope of ultimately\nelevating them to his lofty views on things; but both these efforts proved\nvain, and now he had come to Leipzig with the purpose of framing his own\nmanner of life. It can easily be imagined how the first reading of\nSchopenhauer's _The World as Will and Idea_ worked upon this man, still\nstinging from the bitterest experiences and disappointments. He writes: \"Here\nI saw a mirror in which I espied the world, life, and my own nature depicted\nwith frightful grandeur.\" As my brother, from his very earliest childhood, had\nalways missed both the parent and the educator through our father's untimely\ndeath, he began to regard Schopenhauer with almost filial love and respect. He\ndid not venerate him quite as other men did; Schopenhauer's _personality_ was\nwhat attracted and enchanted him. From the first he was never blind to the\nfaults in his master's system, and in proof of this we have only to refer to\nan essay he wrote in the autumn of 1867, which actually contains a criticism\nof Schopenhauer's philosophy.\n\nNow, in the autumn of 1865, to these two influences, Hellenism and\nSchopenhauer, a third influence was added\u2014one which was to prove the strongest\never exercised over my brother\u2014and it began with his personal introduction to\nRichard Wagner. He was introduced to Wagner by the latter's sister, Frau\nProfessor Brockhaus, and his description of their first meeting, contained in\na letter to Erwin Rohde, is really most affecting. For years, that is to say,\nfrom the time Billow's arrangement of _Tristan and Isolde_ for the pianoforte,\nhad appeared, he had already been a passionate admirer of Wagner's music; but\nnow that the artist himself entered upon the scene of his life, with the whole\nfascinating strength of his strong will, my brother felt that he was in the\npresence of a being whom he, of all modern men, resembled most in regard to\nforce of character.\n\nAgain, in the case of Richard Wagner, my brother, from the first, laid the\nutmost stress upon the man's personality, and could only regard his works and\nviews as an expression of the artist's whole being, despite the fact that he\nby no means understood every one of those works at that time. My brother was\nthe first who ever manifested such enthusiastic affection for Schopenhauer and\nWagner, and he was also the first of that numerous band of young followers who\nultimately inscribed the two great names upon their banner. Whether\nSchopenhauer and Wagner ever really corresponded to the glorified pictures my\nbrother painted of them, both in his letters and other writings, is a question\nwhich we can no longer answer in the affirmative. Perhaps what he saw in them\nwas only what he himself wished to be some day.\n\nThe amount of work my brother succeeded in accomplishing, during his student\ndays, really seems almost incredible. When we examine his record for the years\n1865-67, we can scarcely believe it refers to only two years' industry, for at\na guess no one would hesitate to suggest four years at least.

But in those\ndays, as he himself declares, he still possessed the constitution of a bear.\nHe knew neither what headaches nor indigestion meant, and, despite his short\nsight, his eyes were able to endure the greatest strain without giving him the\nsmallest trouble. That is why, regardless of seriously interrupting his\nstudies, he was so glad at the thought of becoming a soldier in the\nforthcoming autumn of 1867; for he was particularly anxious to discover some\nmeans of employing his bodily strength.\n\nHe discharged his duties as a soldier with the utmost mental and physical\nfreshness, was the crack rider among the recruits of his year, and was\nsincerely sorry when, owing to an accident, he was compelled to leave the\ncolours before the completion of his service. As a result of this accident he\nhad his first dangerous illness.\n\nWhile mounting his horse one day, the beast, which was an uncommonly restive\none, suddenly reared, and, causing him to strike his chest sharply against the\npommel of the saddle, threw him to the ground. My brother then made a second\nattempt to mount, and succeeded this time, notwithstanding the fact that he\nhad severely sprained and torn two muscles in his chest, and had seriously\nbruised the adjacent ribs. For a whole day he did his utmost to pay no heed to\nthe injury, and to overcome the pain it caused him; but in the end he only\nswooned, and a dangerously acute inflammation of the injured tissues was the\nresult. Ultimately he was obliged to consult the famous specialist, Professor\nVolkmann, in Halle, who quickly put him right.\n\nIn October 1868, my brother returned to his studies in Leipzig with double\njoy. These were his plans: to get his doctor's degree as soon as possible; to\nproceed to Paris, Italy, and Greece, make a lengthy stay in each place, and\nthen to return to Leipzig in order to settle there as a privat docent. All\nthese plans were, however, suddenly frustrated owing to his premature call to\nthe University of Bale, where he was invited to assume the duties of\nprofessor. Some of the philological essays he had written in his student days,\nand which were published by the _Rheinische Museum,_ had attracted the\nattention of the Educational Board at Bale. Ratsherr Wilhelm Vischer, as\nrepresenting this body, appealed to Ritschl for fuller information. Now\nRitschl, who had early recognised my brother's extraordinary talents, must\nhave written a letter of such enthusiastic praise (\"Nietzsche is a genius: he\ncan do whatever he chooses to put his mind to\"), that one of the more cautious\nmembers of the council is said to have observed: \"If the proposed candidate be\nreally such a genius, then it were better did we not appoint him; for, in any\ncase, he would only stay a short time at the little University of Bale.\" My\nbrother ultimately accepted the appointment, and, in view of his published\nphilological works, he was immediately granted the doctor's degree by the\nUniversity of Leipzig. He was twenty-four years and six months old when he\ntook up his position as professor in Bale,\u2014and it was with a heavy heart that\nhe proceeded there, for he knew \"the golden period of untrammelled activity\"\nmust cease. He was, however, inspired by the deep wish of being able \"to\ntransfer to his pupils some of that Schopenhauerian earnestness which is\nstamped on the brow of the sublime man.\" \"I should like to be something more\nthan a mere trainer of capable philologists: the present generation of\nteachers, the care of the growing broods,\u2014all this is in my mind.

But no one has any idea of my brother's independent attitude to\nthe science he had selected, to his teachers and to his ideals, and he\ndeceived both himself and us when he passed as a \"disciple\" who really shared\nall the views of his respected master.\n\nOn the 28th May 1869, my brother delivered his inaugural address at Bale\nUniversity, and it is said to have deeply impressed the authorities. The\nsubject of the address was \"Homer and Classical Philology.\"\n\nMusing deeply, the worthy councillors and professors walked homeward. What had\nthey just heard? A young scholar discussing the very justification of his own\nscience in a cool and philosophically critical spirit! A man able to impart so\nmuch artistic glamour to his subject, that the once stale and arid study of\nphilology suddenly struck them\u2014and they were certainly not impressionable\nmen\u2014as the messenger of the gods: \"and just as the Muses descended upon the\ndull and tormented Boeotian peasants, so philology comes into a world full of\ngloomy colours and pictures, full of the deepest, most incurable woes, and\nspeaks to men comfortingly of the beautiful and brilliant godlike figure of a\ndistant, blue, and happy fairyland.\"\n\n\"We have indeed got hold of a rare bird, Herr Ratsherr,\" said one of these\ngentlemen to his companion, and the latter heartily agreed, for my brother's\nappointment had been chiefly his doing.\n\nEven in Leipzig, it was reported that Jacob Burckhardt had said: \"Nietzsche is\nas much an artist as a scholar.\" Privy-Councillor Ritschl told me of this\nhimself, and then he added, with a smile: \"I always said so; he can make his\nscientific discourses as palpitatingly interesting as a French novelist his\nnovels.\"\n\n\"Homer and Classical Philology\"\u2014my brother's inaugural address at the\nUniversity\u2014was by no means the first literary attempt he had made; for we have\nalready seen that he had had papers published by the _Rheinische Museum_ ;\nstill, this particular discourse is important, seeing that it practically\ncontains the programme of many other subsequent essays. I must, however,\nemphasise this fact here, that neither \"Homer and Classical Philology,\" nor\n_The Birth of Tragedy,_ represents a beginning in my brother's career. It is\nreally surprising to see how very soon he actually began grappling with the\nquestions which were to prove the problems of his life.

Nietzsche's was a polyphonic nature, in which the most different and\napparently most antagonistic talents had come together. Philosophy, art, and\nscience\u2014in the form of philology, then\u2014each certainly possessed a part of him.\nThe most wonderful feature\u2014perhaps it might even be called the real\nNietzschean feature\u2014of this versatile creature, was the fact that no eternal\nstrife resulted from the juxtaposition of these inimical traits, that not one\nof them strove to dislodge, or to get the upper hand of, the others. When\nNietzsche renounced the musical career, in order to devote himself to\nphilology, and gave himself up to the most strenuous study, he did not find it\nessential completely to suppress his other tendencies: as before, he continued\nboth to compose and derive pleasure from music, and even studied counterpoint\nsomewhat seriously. Moreover, during his years at Leipzig, when he consciously\ngave himself up to philological research, he began to engross himself in\nSchopenhauer, and was thereby won by philosophy for ever. Everything that\ncould find room took up its abode in him, and these juxtaposed factors, far\nfrom interfering with one another's existence, were rather mutually\nfertilising and stimulating. All those who have read the first volume of the\nbiography with attention must have been struck with the perfect way in which\nthe various impulses in his nature combined in the end to form one general\ntorrent, and how this flowed with ever greater force in the direction of _a\nsingle goal._ Thus science, art, and philosophy developed and became ever more\nclosely related in him, until, in _The Birth of Tragedy,_ they brought forth a\n\"centaur,\" that is to say, a work which would have been an impossible\nachievement to a man with only a single, special talent. This polyphony of\ndifferent talents, all coming to utterance together and producing the richest\nand boldest of harmonies, is the fundamental feature not only of Nietzsche's\nearly days, but of his whole development. It is once again the artist,\nphilosopher, and man of science, who as one man in later years, after many\nwanderings, recantations, and revulsions of feeling, produces that other and\nrarer Centaur of highest rank\u2014 _Zarathustra_.\n\n_The Birth of Tragedy_ requires perhaps a little explaining\u2014more particularly\nas we have now ceased to use either Schopenhauerian or Wagnerian terms of\nexpression. And it was for this reason that five years after its appearance,\nmy brother wrote an introduction to it, in which he very plainly expresses his\ndoubts concerning the views it contains, and the manner in which they are\npresented. The kernel of its thought he always recognised as perfectly\ncorrect; and all he deplored in later days was that he had spoiled the grand\nproblem of Hellenism, as he understood it, by adulterating it with ingredients\ntaken from the world of most modern ideas. As time went on, he grew ever more\nand more anxious to define the deep meaning of this book with greater\nprecision and clearness.

When a certain portion of\nthe projected work on Hellenism was ready and had received the title _Greek\nCheerfulness,_ my brother happened to call upon Wagner at Tribschen in April\n1871, and found him very low-spirited in regard to the mission of his life. My\nbrother was very anxious to take some decisive step to help him, and, laying\nthe plans of his great work on Greece aside, he selected a small portion from\nthe already completed manuscript\u2014a portion dealing with one distinct side of\nHellenism,\u2014to wit, its tragic art. He then associated Wagner's music with it\nand the name Dionysos, and thus took the first step towards that world-\nhistorical view through which we have since grown accustomed to regard Wagner.\n\nFrom the dates of the various notes relating to it, _The Birth of Tragedy_\nmust have been written between the autumn of 1869 and November 1871\u2014a period\nduring which \"a mass of \u00e6sthetic questions and answers\" was fermenting in\nNietzsche's mind. It was first published in January 1872 by E. W. Fritsch, in\nLeipzig, under the title _The Birth of Tragedy out of the Spirit of Music._\nLater on the title was changed to _The Birth of Tragedy, or Hellenism and\nPessimism._\n\nELIZABETH FORSTER-NIETZSCHE.\n\nWEIMAR, _September_ 1905.\n\n[[1]](491753352961627459_51356-h-0.htm.html#FNanchor_1_1) This Introduction by\nE.

While the\nthunder of the battle of W\u00f6rth rolled over Europe, the ruminator and riddle-\nlover, who had to be the parent of this book, sat somewhere in a nook of the\nAlps, lost in riddles and ruminations, consequently very much concerned and\nunconcerned at the same time, and wrote down his meditations on the _Greeks,_\n\u2014the kernel of the curious and almost inaccessible book, to which this belated\nprologue (or epilogue) is to be devoted. A few weeks later: and he found\nhimself under the walls of Metz, still wrestling with the notes of\ninterrogation he had set down concerning the alleged \"cheerfulness\" of the\nGreeks and of Greek art; till at last, in that month of deep suspense, when\npeace was debated at Versailles, he too attained to peace with himself, and,\nslowly recovering from a disease brought home from the field, made up his mind\ndefinitely regarding the \"Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of _Music.\"_ \u2014From\nmusic?

A seductive fortitude with the keenest of\nglances, which _yearns_ for the terrible, as for the enemy, the worthy enemy,\nwith whom it may try its strength? from whom it is willing to learn what\n\"fear\" is? What means _tragic_ myth to the Greeks of the best, strongest,\nbravest era? And the prodigious phenomenon of the Dionysian? And that which\nwas born thereof, tragedy?\u2014And again: that of which tragedy died, the\nSocratism of morality, the dialectics, contentedness and cheerfulness of the\ntheoretical man\u2014indeed? might not this very Socratism be a sign of decline, of\nweariness, of disease, of anarchically disintegrating instincts?

And\nscience itself, our science\u2014ay, viewed as a symptom of life, what really\nsignifies all science? Whither, worse still, _whence_ \u2014all science? Well? Is\nscientism perhaps only fear and evasion of pessimism? A subtle defence\nagainst\u2014 _truth!_ Morally speaking, something like falsehood and cowardice?\nAnd, unmorally speaking, an artifice?

Here, perhaps for the first time, a\npessimism \"Beyond Good and Evil\" announces itself, here that \"perverseness of\ndisposition\" obtains expression and formulation, against which Schopenhauer\nnever grew tired of hurling beforehand his angriest imprecations and\nthunderbolts,\u2014a philosophy which dares to put, derogatorily put, morality\nitself in the world of phenomena, and not only among \"phenomena\" (in the sense\nof the idealistic _terminus technicus_), but among the \"illusions,\" as\nappearance, semblance, error, interpretation, accommodation, art. Perhaps the\ndepth of this _antimoral_ tendency may be best estimated from the guarded and\nhostile silence with which Christianity is treated throughout this\nbook,\u2014Christianity, as being the most extravagant burlesque of the moral theme\nto which mankind has hitherto been obliged to listen. In fact, to the purely\n\u00e6sthetic world-interpretation and justification taught in this book, there is\nno greater antithesis than the Christian dogma, which is _only_ and will be\nonly moral, and which, with its absolute standards, for instance, its\ntruthfulness of God, relegates\u2014that is, disowns, convicts, condemns\u2014art, _all_\nart, to the realm of _falsehood._ Behind such a mode of thought and valuation,\nwhich, if at all genuine, must be hostile to art, I always experienced what\nwas _hostile to life,_ the wrathful, vindictive counterwill to life itself:\nfor all life rests on appearance, art, illusion, optics, necessity of\nperspective and error. From the very first Christianity was, essentially and\nthoroughly, the nausea and surfeit of Life for Life, which only disguised,\nconcealed and decked itself out under the belief in \"another\" or \"better\"\nlife. The hatred of the \"world,\" the curse on the affections, the fear of\nbeauty and sensuality, another world, invented for the purpose of slandering\nthis world the more, at bottom a longing for. Nothingness, for the end, for\nrest, for the \"Sabbath of Sabbaths\"\u2014all this, as also the unconditional will\nof Christianity to recognise _only_ moral values, has always appeared to me as\nthe most dangerous and ominous of all possible forms of a \"will to perish\"; at\nthe least, as the symptom of a most fatal disease, of profoundest weariness,\ndespondency, exhaustion, impoverishment of life,\u2014for before the tribunal of\nmorality (especially Christian, that is, unconditional morality) life _must_\nconstantly and inevitably be the loser, because life _is_ something\nessentially unmoral,\u2014indeed, oppressed with the weight of contempt and the\neverlasting No, life _must_ finally be regarded as unworthy of desire, as in\nitself unworthy. Morality itself what?\u2014may not morality be a \"will to disown\nlife,\" a secret instinct for annihilation, a principle of decay, of\ndepreciation, of slander, a beginning of the end? And, consequently, the\ndanger of dangers?...

That, on the basis of our\nlatter-day German music, I began to fable about the \"spirit of Teutonism,\" as\nif it were on the point of discovering and returning to itself,\u2014ay, at the\nvery time that the German spirit which not so very long before had had the\nwill to the lordship over Europe, the strength to lead and govern Europe,\ntestamentarily and conclusively _resigned_ and, under the pompous pretence of\nempire-founding, effected its transition to mediocritisation, democracy, and\n\"modern ideas.\" In very fact, I have since learned to regard this \"spirit of\nTeutonism\" as something to be despaired of and unsparingly treated, as also\nour present _German music,_ which is Romanticism through and through and the\nmost un-Grecian of all possible forms of art: and moreover a first-rate nerve-\ndestroyer, doubly dangerous for a people given to drinking and revering the\nunclear as a virtue, namely, in its twofold capacity of an intoxicating and\nstupefying narcotic. Of course, apart from all precipitate hopes and faulty\napplications to matters specially modern, with which I then spoiled my first\nbook, the great Dionysian note of interrogation, as set down therein,\ncontinues standing on and on, even with reference to music: how must we\nconceive of a music, which is no longer of Romantic origin, like the German;\nbut of _Dionysian_?...\n\n#### 7.\n\n\u2014But, my dear Sir, if _your_ book is not Romanticism, what in the world is?\nCan the deep hatred of the present, of \"reality\" and \"modern ideas\" be pushed\nfarther than has been done in your artist-metaphysics?\u2014which would rather\nbelieve in Nothing, or in the devil, than in the \"Now\"?

These names we\nborrow from the Greeks, who disclose to the intelligent observer the profound\nmysteries of their view of art, not indeed in concepts, but in the\nimpressively clear figures of their world of deities. It is in connection with\nApollo and Dionysus, the two art-deities of the Greeks, that we learn that\nthere existed in the Grecian world a wide antithesis, in origin and aims,\nbetween the art of the shaper, the Apollonian, and the non-plastic art of\nmusic, that of Dionysus: both these so heterogeneous tendencies run parallel\nto each other, for the most part openly at variance, and continually inciting\neach other to new and more powerful births, to perpetuate in them the strife\nof this antithesis, which is but seemingly bridged over by their mutual term\n\"Art\"; till at last, by a metaphysical miracle of the Hellenic will, they\nappear paired with each other, and through this pairing eventually generate\nthe equally Dionysian and Apollonian art-work of Attic tragedy.\n\nIn order to bring these two tendencies within closer range, let us conceive\nthem first of all as the separate art-worlds of _dreamland_ and _drunkenness;_\nbetween which physiological phenomena a contrast may be observed analogous to\nthat existing between the Apollonian and the Dionysian. In dreams, according\nto the conception of Lucretius, the glorious divine figures first appeared to\nthe souls of men, in dreams the great shaper beheld the charming corporeal\nstructure of superhuman beings, and the Hellenic poet, if consulted on the\nmysteries of poetic inspiration, would likewise have suggested dreams and\nwould have offered an explanation resembling that of Hans Sachs in the\nMeistersingers:\u2014\n\nMein Freund, das grad' ist Dichters Werk,  \ndass er sein Tr\u00e4umen deut' und merk'.  \nGlaubt mir, des Menschen wahrster Wahn  \nwird ihm im Traume aufgethan:  \nall' Dichtkunst und Poeterei  \nist nichts als Wahrtraum-\nDeuterei.[[1]](491753352961627459_51356-h-1.htm.html#Footnote_1_3)  \n\nThe beauteous appearance of the dream-worlds, in the production of which every\nman is a perfect artist, is the presupposition of all plastic art, and in\nfact, as we shall see, of an important half of poetry also.

But, together with the highest life of this\ndream-reality we also have, glimmering through it, the sensation of its\nappearance: such at least is my experience, as to the frequency, ay, normality\nof which I could adduce many proofs, as also the sayings of the poets.

And it is perhaps not\nonly the agreeable and friendly pictures that he realises in himself with such\nperfect understanding: the earnest, the troubled, the dreary, the gloomy, the\nsudden checks, the tricks of fortune, the uneasy presentiments, in short, the\nwhole \"Divine Comedy\" of life, and the Inferno, also pass before him, not\nmerely like pictures on the wall\u2014for he too lives and suffers in these\nscenes,\u2014and yet not without that fleeting sensation of appearance. And perhaps\nmany a one will, like myself, recollect having sometimes called out cheeringly\nand not without success amid the dangers and terrors of dream-life: \"It is a\ndream! I will dream on!\" I have likewise been told of persons capable of\ncontinuing the causality of one and the same dream for three and even more\nsuccessive nights: all of which facts clearly testify that our innermost\nbeing, the common substratum of all of us, experiences our dreams with deep\njoy and cheerful acquiescence.\n\nThis cheerful acquiescence in the dream-experience has likewise been embodied\nby the Greeks in their Apollo: for Apollo, as the god of all shaping energies,\nis also the soothsaying god. He, who (as the etymology of the name indicates)\nis the \"shining one,\" the deity of light, also rules over the fair appearance\nof the inner world of fantasies. The higher truth, the perfection of these\nstates in contrast to the only partially intelligible everyday world, ay, the\ndeep consciousness of nature, healing and helping in sleep and dream, is at\nthe same time the symbolical analogue of the faculty of soothsaying and, in\ngeneral, of the arts, through which life is made possible and worth living.\nBut also that delicate line, which the dream-picture must not overstep\u2014lest it\nact pathologically (in which case appearance, being reality pure and simple,\nwould impose upon us)\u2014must not be wanting in the picture of Apollo: that\nmeasured limitation, that freedom from the wilder emotions, that philosophical\ncalmness of the sculptor-god. His eye must be \"sunlike,\" according to his\norigin; even when it is angry and looks displeased, the sacredness of his\nbeauteous appearance is still there. And so we might apply to Apollo, in an\neccentric sense, what Schopenhauer says of the man wrapt in the veil of\nM\u00e2y\u00e2[[2]](491753352961627459_51356-h-1.htm.html#Footnote_2_4): _Welt als Wille\nund Vorstellung,_ I. p. 416: \"Just as in a stormy sea, unbounded in every\ndirection, rising and falling with howling mountainous waves, a sailor sits in\na boat and trusts in his frail barque: so in the midst of a world of sorrows\nthe individual sits quietly supported by and trusting in his _principium\nindividuationis_.\" Indeed, we might say of Apollo, that in him the unshaken\nfaith in this _principium_ and the quiet sitting of the man wrapt therein have\nreceived their sublimest expression; and we might even designate Apollo as the\nglorious divine image of the _principium individuationis,_ from out of the\ngestures and looks of which all the joy and wisdom of \"appearance,\" together\nwith its beauty, speak to us.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 62954, "end_char_idx": 67079, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75182f7c-834d-4536-a396-bfb95d84c59c": {"__data__": {"id_": "75182f7c-834d-4536-a396-bfb95d84c59c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11e7bbb4-f380-4d2a-b724-0bdf86b1b378", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "aeb08ac84a3c4636a7473de39f346a73d2a08999751ab3cf01bbab79f100626f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b107f9da-c334-4735-817f-a3682b39f6ef", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "1dee19b30e6ceeb504612bfb212e95d08c45f95275000eaf51307ef2e983783b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c276b93e-e208-4291-ae10-beabdde78534", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f88d4c092b11a9dd1807dba424b565e020060f48834585218a5b6e6d2fe0e635", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "416: \"Just as in a stormy sea, unbounded in every\ndirection, rising and falling with howling mountainous waves, a sailor sits in\na boat and trusts in his frail barque: so in the midst of a world of sorrows\nthe individual sits quietly supported by and trusting in his _principium\nindividuationis_.\" Indeed, we might say of Apollo, that in him the unshaken\nfaith in this _principium_ and the quiet sitting of the man wrapt therein have\nreceived their sublimest expression; and we might even designate Apollo as the\nglorious divine image of the _principium individuationis,_ from out of the\ngestures and looks of which all the joy and wisdom of \"appearance,\" together\nwith its beauty, speak to us.\n\nIn the same work Schopenhauer has described to us the stupendous _awe_ which\nseizes upon man, when of a sudden he is at a loss to account for the cognitive\nforms of a phenomenon, in that the principle of reason, in some one of its\nmanifestations, seems to admit of an exception. Add to this awe the blissful\necstasy which rises from the innermost depths of man, ay, of nature, at this\nsame collapse of the _principium individuationis,_ and we shall gain an\ninsight into the being of the _Dionysian,_ which is brought within closest ken\nperhaps by the analogy of _drunkenness._ It is either under the influence of\nthe narcotic draught, of which the hymns of all primitive men and peoples tell\nus, or by the powerful approach of spring penetrating all nature with joy,\nthat those Dionysian emotions awake, in the augmentation of which the\nsubjective vanishes to complete self-forgetfulness. So also in the German\nMiddle Ages singing and dancing crowds, ever increasing in number, were borne\nfrom place to place under this same Dionysian power. In these St. John's and\nSt. Vitus's dancers we again perceive the Bacchic choruses of the Greeks, with\ntheir previous history in Asia Minor, as far back as Babylon and the orgiastic\nSac\u00e6a. There are some, who, from lack of experience or obtuseness, will turn\naway from such phenomena as \"folk-diseases\" with a smile of contempt or pity\nprompted by the consciousness of their own health: of course, the poor\nwretches do not divine what a cadaverous-looking and ghastly aspect this very\n\"health\" of theirs presents when the glowing life of the Dionysian revellers\nrushes past them.\n\nUnder the charm of the Dionysian not only is the covenant between man and man\nagain established, but also estranged, hostile or subjugated nature again\ncelebrates her reconciliation with her lost son, man. Of her own accord earth\nproffers her gifts, and peacefully the beasts of prey approach from the desert\nand the rocks. The chariot of Dionysus is bedecked with flowers and garlands:\npanthers and tigers pass beneath his yoke. Change Beethoven's \"jubilee-song\"\ninto a painting, and, if your imagination be equal to the occasion when the\nawestruck millions sink into the dust, you will then be able to approach the\nDionysian. Now is the slave a free man, now all the stubborn, hostile\nbarriers, which necessity, caprice, or \"shameless fashion\" has set up between\nman and man, are broken down. Now, at the evangel of cosmic harmony, each one\nfeels himself not only united, reconciled, blended with his neighbour, but as\none with him, as if the veil of M\u00e2y\u00e2 has been torn and were now merely\nfluttering in tatters before the mysterious Primordial Unity.

From all quarters of the Ancient World\u2014to say nothing of\nthe modern\u2014from Rome as far as Babylon, we can prove the existence of\nDionysian festivals, the type of which bears, at best, the same relation to\nthe Greek festivals as the bearded satyr, who borrowed his name and attributes\nfrom the goat, does to Dionysus himself. In nearly every instance the centre\nof these festivals lay in extravagant sexual licentiousness, the waves of\nwhich overwhelmed all family life and its venerable traditions; the very\nwildest beasts of nature were let loose here, including that detestable\nmixture of lust and cruelty which has always seemed to me the genuine\n\"witches' draught.\" For some time, however, it would seem that the Greeks were\nperfectly secure and guarded against the feverish agitations of these\nfestivals (\u2014the knowledge of which entered Greece by all the channels of land\nand sea) by the figure of Apollo himself rising here in full pride, who could\nnot have held out the Gorgon's head to a more dangerous power than this\ngrotesquely uncouth Dionysian. It is in Doric art that this majestically-\nrejecting attitude of Apollo perpetuated itself. This opposition became more\nprecarious and even impossible, when, from out of the deepest root of the\nHellenic nature, similar impulses finally broke forth and made way for\nthemselves: the Delphic god, by a seasonably effected reconciliation, was now\ncontented with taking the destructive arms from the hands of his powerful\nantagonist. This reconciliation marks the most important moment in the history\nof the Greek cult: wherever we turn our eyes we may observe the revolutions\nresulting from this event. It was the reconciliation of two antagonists, with\nthe sharp demarcation of the boundary-lines to be thenceforth observed by\neach, and with periodical transmission of testimonials;\u2014in reality, the chasm\nwas not bridged over. But if we observe how, under the pressure of this\nconclusion of peace, the Dionysian power manifested itself, we shall now\nrecognise in the Dionysian orgies of the Greeks, as compared with the\nBabylonian Sac\u00e6a and their retrogression of man to the tiger and the ape, the\nsignificance of festivals of world-redemption and days of transfiguration.

The song and pantomime of\nsuch dually-minded revellers was something new and unheard-of in the Homeric-\nGrecian world; and the Dionysian _music_ in particular excited awe and horror.\nIf music, as it would seem, was previously known as an Apollonian art, it was,\nstrictly speaking, only as the wave-beat of rhythm, the formative power of\nwhich was developed to the representation of Apollonian conditions. The music\nof Apollo was Doric architectonics in tones, but in merely suggested tones,\nsuch as those of the cithara. The very element which forms the essence of\nDionysian music (and hence of music in general) is carefully excluded as un-\nApollonian; namely, the thrilling power of the tone, the uniform stream of the\nmelos, and the thoroughly incomparable world of harmony. In the Dionysian\ndithyramb man is incited to the highest exaltation of all his symbolic\nfaculties; something never before experienced struggles for utterance\u2014the\nannihilation of the veil of M\u00e2y\u00e2, Oneness as genius of the race, ay, of\nnature. The essence of nature is now to be expressed symbolically; a new world\nof symbols is required; for once the entire symbolism of the body, not only\nthe symbolism of the lips, face, and speech, but the whole pantomime of\ndancing which sets all the members into rhythmical motion. Thereupon the other\nsymbolic powers, those of music, in rhythmics, dynamics, and harmony, suddenly\nbecome impetuous. To comprehend this collective discharge of all the symbolic\npowers, a man must have already attained that height of self-abnegation, which\nwills to express itself symbolically through these powers: the Dithyrambic\nvotary of Dionysus is therefore understood only by those like himself! With\nwhat astonishment must the Apollonian Greek have beheld him! With an\nastonishment, which was all the greater the more it was mingled with the\nshuddering suspicion that all this was in reality not so very foreign to him,\nyea, that, like unto a veil, his Apollonian consciousness only hid this\nDionysian world from his view.\n\n#### 3.\n\nIn order to comprehend this, we must take down the artistic structure of the\n_Apollonian culture,_ as it were, stone by stone, till we behold the\nfoundations on which it rests. Here we observe first of all the glorious\n_Olympian_ figures of the gods, standing on the gables of this structure,\nwhose deeds, represented in far-shining reliefs, adorn its friezes. Though\nApollo stands among them as an individual deity, side by side with others, and\nwithout claim to priority of rank, we must not suffer this fact to mislead us.\nThe same impulse which embodied itself in Apollo has, in general, given birth\nto this whole Olympian world, and in this sense we may regard Apollo as the\nfather thereof. What was the enormous need from which proceeded such an\nillustrious group of Olympian beings?\n\nWhosoever, with another religion in his heart, approaches these Olympians and\nseeks among them for moral elevation, even for sanctity, for incorporeal\nspiritualisation, for sympathetic looks of love, will soon be obliged to turn\nhis back on them, discouraged and disappointed.

And so the spectator will perhaps stand quite bewildered before this\nfantastic exuberance of life, and ask himself what magic potion these madly\nmerry men could have used for enjoying life, so that, wherever they turned\ntheir eyes, Helena, the ideal image of their own existence \"floating in sweet\nsensuality,\" smiled upon them. But to this spectator, already turning\nbackwards, we must call out: \"depart not hence, but hear rather what Greek\nfolk-wisdom says of this same life, which with such inexplicable cheerfulness\nspreads out before thee.\" There is an ancient story that king Midas hunted in\nthe forest a long time for the wise _Silenus,_ the companion of Dionysus,\nwithout capturing him. When at last he fell into his hands, the king asked\nwhat was best of all and most desirable for man. Fixed and immovable, the\ndemon remained silent; till at last, forced by the king, he broke out with\nshrill laughter into these words: \"Oh, wretched race of a day, children of\nchance and misery, why do ye compel me to say to you what it were most\nexpedient for you not to hear? What is best of all is for ever beyond your\nreach: not to be born, not to _be_ , to be _nothing._ The second best for you,\nhowever, is soon to die.\"\n\nHow is the Olympian world of deities related to this folk-wisdom? Even as the\nrapturous vision of the tortured martyr to his sufferings.\n\nNow the Olympian magic mountain opens, as it were, to our view and shows to us\nits roots. The Greek knew and felt the terrors and horrors of existence: to be\nable to live at all, he had to interpose the shining dream-birth of the\nOlympian world between himself and them. The excessive distrust of the titanic\npowers of nature, the Moira throning inexorably over all knowledge, the\nvulture of the great philanthropist Prometheus, the terrible fate of the wise\n\u0152dipus, the family curse of the Atrid\u00e6 which drove Orestes to matricide; in\nshort, that entire philosophy of the sylvan god, with its mythical exemplars,\nwhich wrought the ruin of the melancholy Etruscans\u2014was again and again\nsurmounted anew by the Greeks through the artistic _middle world_ of the\nOlympians, or at least veiled and withdrawn from sight. To be able to live,\nthe Greeks had, from direst necessity, to create these gods: which process we\nmay perhaps picture to ourselves in this manner: that out of the original\nTitan thearchy of terror the Olympian thearchy of joy was evolved, by slow\ntransitions, through the Apollonian impulse to beauty, even as roses break\nforth from thorny bushes. How else could this so sensitive people, so vehement\nin its desires, so singularly qualified for _sufferings_ have endured\nexistence, if it had not been exhibited to them in their gods, surrounded with\na higher glory? The same impulse which calls art into being, as the complement\nand consummation of existence, seducing to a continuation of life, caused also\nthe Olympian world to arise, in which the Hellenic \"will\" held up before\nitself a transfiguring mirror.

Existence under\nthe bright sunshine of such gods is regarded as that which is desirable in\nitself, and the real _grief_ of the Homeric men has reference to parting from\nit, especially to early parting: so that we might now say of them, with a\nreversion of the Silenian wisdom, that \"to die early is worst of all for them,\nthe second worst is\u2014some day to die at all.\" If once the lamentation is heard,\nit will ring out again, of the short-lived Achilles, of the leaf-like change\nand vicissitude of the human race, of the decay of the heroic age. It is not\nunworthy of the greatest hero to long for a continuation of life, ay, even as\na day-labourer. So vehemently does the \"will,\" at the Apollonian stage of\ndevelopment, long for this existence, so completely at one does the Homeric\nman feel himself with it, that the very lamentation becomes its song of\npraise.\n\nHere we must observe that this harmony which is so eagerly contemplated by\nmodern man, in fact, this oneness of man with nature, to express which\nSchiller introduced the technical term \"na\u00efve,\" is by no means such a simple,\nnaturally resulting and, as it were, inevitable condition, which _must_ be\nfound at the gate of every culture leading to a paradise of man: this could be\nbelieved only by an age which sought to picture to itself Rousseau's \u00c9mile\nalso as an artist, and imagined it had found in Homer such an artist \u00c9mile,\nreared at Nature's bosom. Wherever we meet with the \"na\u00efve\" in art, it behoves\nus to recognise the highest effect of the Apollonian culture, which in the\nfirst place has always to overthrow some Titanic empire and slay monsters, and\nwhich, through powerful dazzling representations and pleasurable illusions,\nmust have triumphed over a terrible depth of world-contemplation and a most\nkeen susceptibility to suffering. But how seldom is the na\u00efve\u2014that complete\nabsorption, in the beauty of appearance\u2014attained! And hence how inexpressibly\nsublime is _Homer,_ who, as unit being, bears the same relation to this\nApollonian folk-culture as the unit dream-artist does to the dream-faculty of\nthe people and of Nature in general. The Homeric \"na\u00efvet\u00e9\" can be comprehended\nonly as the complete triumph of the Apollonian illusion: it is the same kind\nof illusion as Nature so frequently employs to compass her ends. The true goal\nis veiled by a phantasm: we stretch out our hands for the latter, while Nature\nattains the former through our illusion. In the Greeks the \"will\" desired to\ncontemplate itself in the transfiguration of the genius and the world of art;\nin order to glorify themselves, its creatures had to feel themselves worthy of\nglory; they had to behold themselves again in a higher sphere, without this\nconsummate world of contemplation acting as an imperative or reproach.

When we realise to ourselves the dreamer, as, in the midst of the\nillusion of the dream-world and without disturbing it, he calls out to\nhimself: \"it is a dream, I will dream on\"; when we must thence infer a deep\ninner joy in dream-contemplation; when, on the other hand, to be at all able\nto dream with this inner joy in contemplation, we must have completely\nforgotten the day and its terrible obtrusiveness, we may, under the direction\nof the dream-reading Apollo, interpret all these phenomena to ourselves\nsomewhat as follows. Though it is certain that of the two halves of life, the\nwaking and the dreaming, the former appeals to us as by far the more\npreferred, important, excellent and worthy of being lived, indeed, as that\nwhich alone is lived: yet, with reference to that mysterious ground of our\nbeing of which we are the phenomenon, I should, paradoxical as it may seem, be\ninclined to maintain the very opposite estimate of the value of dream life.\nFor the more clearly I perceive in nature those all-powerful art impulses, and\nin them a fervent longing for appearance, for redemption through appearance,\nthe more I feel myself driven to the metaphysical assumption that the Verily-\nExistent and Primordial Unity, as the Eternally Suffering and Self-\nContradictory, requires the rapturous vision, the joyful appearance, for its\ncontinuous salvation: which appearance we, who are completely wrapt in it and\ncomposed of it, must regard as the Verily Non-existent,\u2014 _i.e.,_ as a\nperpetual unfolding in time, space and causality,\u2014in other words, as empiric\nreality. If we therefore waive the consideration of our own \"reality\" for the\npresent, if we conceive our empiric existence, and that of the world\ngenerally, as a representation of the Primordial Unity generated every moment,\nwe shall then have to regard the dream as an _appearance of appearance,_ hence\nas a still higher gratification of the primordial desire for appearance. It is\nfor this same reason that the innermost heart of Nature experiences that\nindescribable joy in the na\u00efve artist and in the na\u00efve work of art, which is\nlikewise only \"an appearance of appearance.\" In a symbolic painting, _Raphael_\n, himself one of these immortal \"na\u00efve\" ones, has represented to us this\ndepotentiating of appearance to appearance, the primordial process of the\nna\u00efve artist and at the same time of Apollonian culture. In his\n_Transfiguration,_ the lower half, with the possessed boy, the despairing\nbearers, the helpless, terrified disciples, shows to us the reflection of\neternal primordial pain, the sole basis of the world: the \"appearance\" here is\nthe counter-appearance of eternal Contradiction, the father of things.

And thus, parallel to the \u00e6sthetic\nnecessity for beauty, there run the demands \"know thyself\" and \"not too much,\"\nwhile presumption and undueness are regarded as the truly hostile demons of\nthe non-Apollonian sphere, hence as characteristics of the pre-Apollonian age,\nthat of the Titans, and of the extra-Apollonian world, that of the barbarians.\nBecause of his Titan-like love for man, Prometheus had to be torn to pieces by\nvultures; because of his excessive wisdom, which solved the riddle of the\nSphinx, \u0152dipus had to plunge into a bewildering vortex of monstrous crimes:\nthus did the Delphic god interpret the Grecian past.\n\nSo also the effects wrought by the _Dionysian_ appeared \"titanic\" and\n\"barbaric\" to the Apollonian Greek: while at the same time he could not\nconceal from himself that he too was inwardly related to these overthrown\nTitans and heroes. Indeed, he had to recognise still more than this: his\nentire existence, with all its beauty and moderation, rested on a hidden\nsubstratum of suffering and of knowledge, which was again disclosed to him by\nthe Dionysian. And lo! Apollo could not live without Dionysus! The \"titanic\"\nand the \"barbaric\" were in the end not less necessary than the Apollonian. And\nnow let us imagine to ourselves how the ecstatic tone of the Dionysian\nfestival sounded in ever more luring and bewitching strains into this\nartificially confined world built on appearance and moderation, how in these\nstrains all the _undueness_ of nature, in joy, sorrow, and knowledge, even to\nthe transpiercing shriek, became audible: let us ask ourselves what meaning\ncould be attached to the psalmodising artist of Apollo, with the phantom harp-\nsound, as compared with this demonic folk-song! The muses of the arts of\n\"appearance\" paled before an art which, in its intoxication, spoke the truth,\nthe wisdom of Silenus cried \"woe! woe!\" against the cheerful Olympians. The\nindividual, with all his boundaries and due proportions, went under in the\nself-oblivion of the Dionysian states and forgot the Apollonian precepts. The\n_Undueness_ revealed itself as truth, contradiction, the bliss born of pain,\ndeclared itself but of the heart of nature. And thus, wherever the Dionysian\nprevailed, the Apollonian was routed and annihilated.

But it is quite as\ncertain that, where the first assault was successfully withstood, the\nauthority and majesty of the Delphic god exhibited itself as more rigid and\nmenacing than ever. For I can only explain to myself the _Doric_ state and\nDoric art as a permanent war-camp of the Apollonian: only by incessant\nopposition to the titanic-barbaric nature of the Dionysian was it possible for\nan art so defiantly-prim, so encompassed with bulwarks, a training so warlike\nand rigorous, a constitution so cruel and relentless, to last for any length\nof time.\n\nUp to this point we have enlarged upon the observation made at the beginning\nof this essay: how the Dionysian and the Apollonian, in ever new births\nsucceeding and mutually augmenting one another, controlled the Hellenic\ngenius: how from out the age of \"bronze,\" with its Titan struggles and\nrigorous folk-philosophy, the Homeric world develops under the fostering sway\nof the Apollonian impulse to beauty, how this \"na\u00efve\" splendour is again\noverwhelmed by the inbursting flood of the Dionysian, and how against this new\npower the Apollonian rises to the austere majesty of Doric art and the Doric\nview of things. If, then, in this way, in the strife of these two hostile\nprinciples, the older Hellenic history falls into four great periods of art,\nwe are now driven to inquire after the ulterior purpose of these unfoldings\nand processes, unless perchance we should regard the last-attained period, the\nperiod of Doric art, as the end and aim of these artistic impulses: and here\nthe sublime and highly celebrated art-work of _Attic tragedy_ and dramatic\ndithyramb presents itself to our view as the common goal of both these\nimpulses, whose mysterious union, after many and long precursory struggles,\nfound its glorious consummation in such a child,\u2014which is at once Antigone and\nCassandra.\n\n#### 5.\n\nWe now approach the real purpose of our investigation, which aims at acquiring\na knowledge of the Dionyso-Apollonian genius and his art-work, or at least an\nanticipatory understanding of the mystery of the aforesaid union. Here we\nshall ask first of all where that new germ which subsequently developed into\ntragedy and dramatic dithyramb first makes itself perceptible in the Hellenic\nworld. The ancients themselves supply the answer in symbolic form, when they\nplace _Homer_ and _Archilochus_ as the forefathers and torch-bearers of Greek\npoetry side by side on gems, sculptures, etc., in the sure conviction that\nonly these two thoroughly original compeers, from whom a stream of fire flows\nover the whole of Greek posterity, should be taken into consideration.

Hence our \u00e6sthetics must first solve the problem\nas to how the \"lyrist\" is possible as an artist: he who according to the\nexperience of all ages continually says \"I\" and sings off to us the entire\nchromatic scale of his passions and desires. This very Archilochus appals us,\nalongside of Homer, by his cries of hatred and scorn, by the drunken outbursts\nof his desire. Is not just he then, who has been called the first subjective\nartist, the non-artist proper? But whence then the reverence which was shown\nto him\u2014the poet\u2014in very remarkable utterances by the Delphic oracle itself,\nthe focus of \"objective\" art?\n\n_Schiller_ has enlightened us concerning his poetic procedure by a\npsychological observation, inexplicable to himself, yet not apparently open to\nany objection. He acknowledges that as the preparatory state to the act of\npoetising he had not perhaps before him or within him a series of pictures\nwith co-ordinate causality of thoughts, but rather a _musical mood_ (\"The\nperception with me is at first without a clear and definite object; this forms\nitself later. A certain musical mood of mind precedes, and only after this\ndoes the poetical idea follow with me.\") Add to this the most important\nphenomenon of all ancient lyric poetry, _the union,_ regarded everywhere as\nnatural, _of the lyrist with the musician,_ their very identity,\nindeed,\u2014compared with which our modern lyric poetry is like the statue of a\ngod without a head,\u2014and we may now, on the basis of our metaphysics of\n\u00e6sthetics set forth above, interpret the lyrist to ourselves as follows. As\nDionysian artist he is in the first place become altogether one with the\nPrimordial Unity, its pain and contradiction, and he produces the copy of this\nPrimordial Unity as music, granting that music has been correctly termed a\nrepetition and a recast of the world; but now, under the Apollonian dream-\ninspiration, this music again becomes visible to him as in a _symbolic dream-\npicture._ The formless and intangible reflection of the primordial pain in\nmusic, with its redemption in appearance, then generates a second mirroring as\na concrete symbol or example. The artist has already surrendered his\nsubjectivity in the Dionysian process: the picture which now shows to him his\noneness with the heart of the world, is a dream-scene, which embodies the\nprimordial contradiction and primordial pain, together with the primordial\njoy, of appearance. The \"I\" of the lyrist sounds therefore from the abyss of\nbeing: its \"subjectivity,\" in the sense of the modern \u00e6sthetes, is a fiction.\nWhen Archilochus, the first lyrist of the Greeks, makes known both his mad\nlove and his contempt to the daughters of Lycambes, it is not his passion\nwhich dances before us in orgiastic frenzy: we see Dionysus and the M\u00e6nads, we\nsee the drunken reveller Archilochus sunk down to sleep\u2014as Euripides depicts\nit in the Bacch\u00e6, the sleep on the high Alpine pasture, in the noonday\nsun:\u2014and now Apollo approaches and touches him with the laurel.

In truth, Archilochus, the\npassionately inflamed, loving and hating man, is but a vision of the genius,\nwho by this time is no longer Archilochus, but a genius of the world, who\nexpresses his primordial pain symbolically in the figure of the man\nArchilochus: while the subjectively willing and desiring man, Archilochus, can\nnever at any time be a poet.

In it pure knowing\ncomes to us as it were to deliver us from desire and the stress thereof: we\nfollow, but only for an instant; for desire, the remembrance of our personal\nends, tears us anew from peaceful contemplation; yet ever again the next\nbeautiful surrounding in which the pure will-less knowledge presents itself to\nus, allures us away from desire. Therefore, in song and in the lyrical mood,\ndesire (the personal interest of the ends) and the pure perception of the\nsurrounding which presents itself, are wonderfully mingled with each other;\nconnections between them are sought for and imagined; the subjective\ndisposition, the affection of the will, imparts its own hue to the\ncontemplated surrounding, and conversely, the surroundings communicate the\nreflex of their colour to the will. The true song is the expression of the\nwhole of this mingled and divided state of mind.\"\n\nWho could fail to see in this description that lyric poetry is here\ncharacterised as an imperfectly attained art, which seldom and only as it were\nin leaps arrives at its goal, indeed, as a semi-art, the essence of which is\nsaid to consist in this, that desire and pure contemplation, _i.e.,_ the\nun\u00e6sthetic and the \u00e6sthetic condition, are wonderfully mingled with each\nother? We maintain rather, that this entire antithesis, according to which, as\naccording to some standard of value, Schopenhauer, too, still classifies the\narts, the antithesis between the subjective and the objective, is quite out of\nplace in \u00e6sthetics, inasmuch as the subject _i.e.,_ the desiring individual\nwho furthers his own egoistic ends, can be conceived only as the adversary,\nnot as the origin of art. In so far as the subject is the artist, however, he\nhas already been released from his individual will, and has become as it were\nthe medium, through which the one verily existent Subject celebrates his\nredemption in appearance. For this one thing must above all be clear to us, to\nour humiliation _and_ exaltation, that the entire comedy of art is not at all\nperformed, say, for our betterment and culture, and that we are just as little\nthe true authors of this art-world: rather we may assume with regard to\nourselves, that its true author uses us as pictures and artistic projections,\nand that we have our highest dignity in our significance as works of art\u2014for\nonly as an _\u00e6sthetic phenomenon_ is existence and the world eternally\n_justified:_ \u2014while of course our consciousness of this our specific\nsignificance hardly differs from the kind of consciousness which the soldiers\npainted on canvas have of the battle represented thereon.

Quoted with a few\nchanges.\n\n#### 6.\n\nWith reference to Archilochus, it has been established by critical research\nthat he introduced the _folk-song_ into literature, and, on account thereof,\ndeserved, according to the general estimate of the Greeks, his unique position\nalongside of Homer. But what is this popular folk-song in contrast to the\nwholly Apollonian epos? What else but the _perpetuum vestigium_ of a union of\nthe Apollonian and the Dionysian? Its enormous diffusion among all peoples,\nstill further enhanced by ever new births, testifies to the power of this\nartistic double impulse of nature: which leaves its vestiges in the popular\nsong in like manner as the orgiastic movements of a people perpetuate\nthemselves in its music. Indeed, one might also furnish historical proofs,\nthat every period which is highly productive in popular songs has been most\nviolently stirred by Dionysian currents, which we must always regard as the\nsubstratum and prerequisite of the popular song.\n\nFirst of all, however, we regard the popular song as the musical mirror of the\nworld, as the Original melody, which now seeks for itself a parallel dream-\nphenomenon and expresses it in poetry. _Melody is therefore primary and\nuniversal,_ and as such may admit of several objectivations, in several texts.\nLikewise, in the na\u00efve estimation of the people, it is regarded as by far the\nmore important and necessary. Melody generates the poem out of itself by an\never-recurring process. _The strophic form of the popular song_ points to the\nsame phenomenon, which I always beheld with astonishment, till at last I found\nthis explanation. Any one who in accordance with this theory examines a\ncollection of popular songs, such as \"Des Knaben Wunderhorn,\" will find\ninnumerable instances of the perpetually productive melody scattering picture\nsparks all around: which in their variegation, their abrupt change, their mad\nprecipitance, manifest a power quite unknown to the epic appearance and its\nsteady flow. From the point of view of the epos, this unequal and irregular\npictorial world of lyric poetry must be simply condemned: and the solemn epic\nrhapsodists of the Apollonian festivals in the age of Terpander have certainly\ndone so.\n\nAccordingly, we observe that in the poetising of the popular song, language is\nstrained to its utmost _to imitate music;_ and hence a new world of poetry\nbegins with Archilochus, which is fundamentally opposed to the Homeric. And in\nsaying this we have pointed out the only possible relation between poetry and\nmusic, between word and tone: the word, the picture, the concept here seeks an\nexpression analogous to music and now experiences in itself the power of\nmusic.

In this sense we may discriminate between two main currents in the\nhistory of the language of the Greek people, according as their language\nimitated either the world of phenomena and of pictures, or the world of music.\nOne has only to reflect seriously on the linguistic difference with regard to\ncolour, syntactical structure, and vocabulary in Homer and Pindar, in order to\ncomprehend the significance of this contrast; indeed, it becomes palpably\nclear to us that in the period between Homer and Pindar the _orgiastic flute\ntones of Olympus_ must have sounded forth, which, in an age as late as\nAristotle's, when music was infinitely more developed, transported people to\ndrunken enthusiasm, and which, when their influence was first felt,\nundoubtedly incited all the poetic means of expression of contemporaneous man\nto imitation. I here call attention to a familiar phenomenon of our own times,\nagainst which our \u00e6sthetics raises many objections. We again and again have\noccasion to observe how a symphony of Beethoven compels the individual hearers\nto use figurative speech, though the appearance presented by a collocation of\nthe different pictorial world generated by a piece of music may be never so\nfantastically diversified and even contradictory. To practise its small wit on\nsuch compositions, and to overlook a phenomenon which is certainly worth\nexplaining, is quite in keeping with this \u00e6sthetics. Indeed, even if the tone-\npoet has spoken in pictures concerning a composition, when for instance he\ndesignates a certain symphony as the \"pastoral\" symphony, or a passage therein\nas \"the scene by the brook,\" or another as the \"merry gathering of rustics,\"\nthese are likewise only symbolical representations born out of music\u2014and not\nperhaps the imitated objects of music\u2014representations which can give us no\ninformation whatever concerning the _Dionysian_ content of music, and which in\nfact have no distinctive value of their own alongside of other pictorical\nexpressions. This process of a discharge of music in pictures we have now to\ntransfer to some youthful, linguistically productive people, to get a notion\nas to how the strophic popular song originates, and how the entire faculty of\nspeech is stimulated by this new principle of imitation of music.\n\nIf, therefore, we may regard lyric poetry as the effulguration of music in\npictures and concepts, we can now ask: \"how does music _appear_ in the mirror\nof symbolism and conception?\" _It appears as will,_ taking the word in the\nSchopenhauerian sense, _i.e.,_ as the antithesis of the \u00e6sthetic, purely\ncontemplative, and passive frame of mind. Here, however, we must discriminate\nas sharply as possible between the concept of essentiality and the concept of\nphenominality; for music, according to its essence, cannot be will, because as\nsuch it would have to be wholly banished from the domain of art\u2014for the will\nis the un\u00e6sthetic-in-itself;\u2014yet it appears as will. For in order to express\nthe phenomenon of music in pictures, the lyrist requires all the stirrings of\npassion, from the whispering of infant desire to the roaring of madness. Under\nthe impulse to speak of music in Apollonian symbols, he conceives of all\nnature, and himself therein, only as the eternally willing, desiring, longing\nexistence. But in so far as he interprets music by means of pictures, he\nhimself rests in the quiet calm of Apollonian contemplation, however much all\naround him which he beholds through the medium of music is in a state of\nconfused and violent motion.

Such is the phenomenon of the lyrist: as Apollonian genius\nhe interprets music through the image of the will, while he himself,\ncompletely released from the avidity of the will, is the pure, undimmed eye of\nday.\n\nOur whole disquisition insists on this, that lyric poetry is dependent on the\nspirit of music just as music itself in its absolute sovereignty does not\n_require_ the picture and the concept, but only _endures_ them as\naccompaniments. The poems of the lyrist can express nothing which has not\nalready been contained in the vast universality and absoluteness of the music\nwhich compelled him to use figurative speech. By no means is it possible for\nlanguage adequately to render the cosmic symbolism of music, for the very\nreason that music stands in symbolic relation to the primordial contradiction\nand primordial pain in the heart of the Primordial Unity, and therefore\nsymbolises a sphere which is above all appearance and before all phenomena.\nRather should we say that all phenomena, compared with it, are but symbols:\nhence _language,_ as the organ and symbol of phenomena, cannot at all disclose\nthe innermost essence, of music; language can only be in superficial contact\nwith music when it attempts to imitate music; while the profoundest\nsignificance of the latter cannot be brought one step nearer to us by all the\neloquence of lyric poetry.\n\n#### 7.\n\nWe shall now have to avail ourselves of all the principles of art hitherto\nconsidered, in order to find our way through the labyrinth, as we must\ndesignate _the origin of Greek tragedy._ I shall not be charged with absurdity\nin saying that the problem of this origin has as yet not even been seriously\nstated, not to say solved, however often the fluttering tatters of ancient\ntradition have been sewed together in sundry combinations and torn asunder\nagain. This tradition tells us in the most unequivocal terms, _that tragedy\nsprang from the tragic chorus,_ and was originally only chorus and nothing but\nchorus: and hence we feel it our duty to look into the heart of this tragic\nchorus as being the real proto-drama, without in the least contenting\nourselves with current art-phraseology\u2014according to which the chorus is the\nideal spectator, or represents the people in contrast to the regal side of the\nscene. The latter explanatory notion, which sounds sublime to many a\npolitician\u2014that the immutable moral law was embodied by the democratic\nAthenians in the popular chorus, which always carries its point over the\npassionate excesses and extravagances of kings\u2014may be ever so forcibly\nsuggested by an observation of Aristotle: still it has no bearing on the\noriginal formation of tragedy, inasmuch as the entire antithesis of king and\npeople, and, in general, the whole politico-social sphere, is excluded from\nthe purely religious beginnings of tragedy; but, considering the well-known\nclassical form of the chorus in \u00c6schylus and Sophocles, we should even deem it\nblasphemy to speak here of the anticipation of a \"constitutional\nrepresentation of the people,\" from which blasphemy others have not shrunk,\nhowever.

W. Schlegel, who advises us to regard the chorus, in a manner, as\nthe essence and extract of the crowd of spectators,\u2014as the \"ideal spectator.\"\nThis view when compared with the historical tradition that tragedy was\noriginally only chorus, reveals itself in its true character, as a crude,\nunscientific, yet brilliant assertion, which, however, has acquired its\nbrilliancy only through its concentrated form of expression, through the truly\nGermanic bias in favour of whatever is called \"ideal,\" and through our\nmomentary astonishment. For we are indeed astonished the moment we compare our\nwell-known theatrical public with this chorus, and ask ourselves if it could\never be possible to idealise something analogous to the Greek chorus out of\nsuch a public. We tacitly deny this, and now wonder as much at the boldness of\nSchlegel's assertion as at the totally different nature of the Greek public.\nFor hitherto we always believed that the true spectator, be he who he may, had\nalways to remain conscious of having before him a work of art, and not an\nempiric reality: whereas the tragic chorus of the Greeks is compelled to\nrecognise real beings in the figures of the stage. The chorus of the Oceanides\nreally believes that it sees before it the Titan Prometheus, and considers\nitself as real as the god of the scene. And are we to own that he is the\nhighest and purest type of spectator, who, like the Oceanides, regards\nPrometheus as real and present in body? And is it characteristic of the ideal\nspectator that he should run on the stage and free the god from his torments?\nWe had believed in an \u00e6sthetic public, and considered the individual spectator\nthe better qualified the more he was capable of viewing a work of art as art,\nthat is, \u00e6sthetically; but now the Schlegelian expression has intimated to us,\nthat the perfect ideal spectator does not at all suffer the world of the\nscenes to act \u00e6sthetically on him, but corporeo-empirically. Oh, these Greeks!\nwe have sighed; they will upset our \u00e6sthetics! But once accustomed to it, we\nhave reiterated the saying of Schlegel, as often as the subject of the chorus\nhas been broached.\n\nBut the tradition which is so explicit here speaks against Schlegel: the\nchorus as such, without the stage,\u2014the primitive form of tragedy,\u2014and the\nchorus of ideal spectators do not harmonise. What kind of art would that be\nwhich was extracted from the concept of the spectator, and whereof we are to\nregard the \"spectator as such\" as the true form? The spectator without the\nplay is something absurd. We fear that the birth of tragedy can be explained\nneither by the high esteem for the moral intelligence of the multitude nor by\nthe concept of the spectator without the play; and we regard the problem as\ntoo deep to be even so much as touched by such superficial modes of\ncontemplation.\n\nAn infinitely more valuable insight into the signification of the chorus had\nalready been displayed by Schiller in the celebrated Preface to his Bride of\nMessina, where he regarded the chorus as a living wall which tragedy draws\nround herself to guard her from contact with the world of reality, and to\npreserve her ideal domain and poetical freedom.\n\nIt is with this, his chief weapon, that Schiller combats the ordinary\nconception of the natural, the illusion ordinarily required in dramatic\npoetry. He contends that while indeed the day on the stage is merely\nartificial, the architecture only symbolical, and the metrical dialogue purely\nideal in character, nevertheless an erroneous view still prevails in the main:\nthat it is not enough to tolerate merely as a poetical license _that_ which is\nin reality the essence of all poetry. The introduction of the chorus is, he\nsays, the decisive step by which war is declared openly and honestly against\nall naturalism in art.\u2014It is, methinks, for disparaging this mode of\ncontemplation that our would-be superior age has coined the disdainful\ncatchword \"pseudo-idealism.\"", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 116065, "end_char_idx": 120281, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0137bb96-2548-4dd4-9ba6-7aab4f98828e": {"__data__": {"id_": "0137bb96-2548-4dd4-9ba6-7aab4f98828e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11e7bbb4-f380-4d2a-b724-0bdf86b1b378", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "aeb08ac84a3c4636a7473de39f346a73d2a08999751ab3cf01bbab79f100626f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4a9309f6-612a-422c-b5bb-38d6fb611179", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "1e9e0c459876b2b12f426b5c993d21967b026cc855a33266e1783007d5db6b01", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "75368e48-e744-4dae-a9d4-152ebe907d84", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ee135f4c1dbc0ac6b708baea8f1662edff16b58d8c73dfc71d9ff64c76a92ada", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "It is with this, his chief weapon, that Schiller combats the ordinary\nconception of the natural, the illusion ordinarily required in dramatic\npoetry.

An art indeed\nexists also here, as in certain novels much in vogue at present: but let no\none pester us with the claim that by this art the Schiller-Goethian \"Pseudo-\nidealism\" has been vanquished.\n\nIt is indeed an \"ideal\" domain, as Schiller rightly perceived, upon\u2014which the\nGreek satyric chorus, the chorus of primitive tragedy, was wont to walk, a\ndomain raised far above the actual path of mortals. The Greek framed for this\nchorus the suspended scaffolding of a fictitious _natural state_ and placed\nthereon fictitious _natural beings._ It is on this foundation that tragedy\ngrew up, and so it could of course dispense from the very first with a painful\nportrayal of reality. Yet it is, not an arbitrary world placed by fancy\nbetwixt heaven and earth; rather is it a world possessing the same reality and\ntrustworthiness that Olympus with its dwellers possessed for the believing\nHellene. The satyr, as being the Dionysian chorist, lives in a religiously\nacknowledged reality under the sanction of the myth and cult. That tragedy\nbegins with him, that the Dionysian wisdom of tragedy speaks through him, is\njust as surprising a phenomenon to us as, in general, the derivation of\ntragedy from the chorus. Perhaps we shall get a starting-point for our\ninquiry, if I put forward the proposition that the satyr, the fictitious\nnatural being, is to the man of culture what Dionysian music is to\ncivilisation. Concerning this latter, Richard Wagner says that it is\nneutralised by music even as lamplight by daylight. In like manner, I believe,\nthe Greek man of culture felt himself neutralised in the presence of the\nsatyric chorus: and this is the most immediate effect of the Dionysian\ntragedy, that the state and society, and, in general, the gaps between man and\nman give way to an overwhelming feeling of oneness, which leads back to the\nheart of nature. The metaphysical comfort,\u2014with which, as I have here\nintimated, every true tragedy dismisses us\u2014that, in spite of the perpetual\nchange of phenomena, life at bottom is indestructibly powerful and\npleasurable, this comfort appears with corporeal lucidity as the satyric\nchorus, as the chorus of natural beings, who live ineradicable as it were\nbehind all civilisation, and who, in spite of the ceaseless change of\ngenerations and the history of nations, remain for ever the same.\n\nWith this chorus the deep-minded Hellene, who is so singularly qualified for\nthe most delicate and severe suffering, consoles himself:\u2014he who has glanced\nwith piercing eye into the very heart of the terrible destructive processes of\nso-called universal history, as also into the cruelty of nature, and is in\ndanger of longing for a Buddhistic negation of the will.

It is by this gulf of oblivion that the everyday world and the\nworld of Dionysian reality are separated from each other. But as soon as this\neveryday reality rises again in consciousness, it is felt as such, and\nnauseates us; an ascetic will-paralysing mood is the fruit of these states. In\nthis sense the Dionysian man may be said to resemble Hamlet: both have for\nonce seen into the true nature of things, \u2014they have _perceived,_ but they are\nloath to act; for their action cannot change the eternal nature of things;\nthey regard it as shameful or ridiculous that one should require of them to\nset aright the time which is out of joint. Knowledge kills action, action\nrequires the veil of illusion\u2014it is this lesson which Hamlet teaches, and not\nthe cheap wisdom of John-a-Dreams who from too much reflection, as it were\nfrom a surplus of possibilities, does not arrive at action at all. Not\nreflection, no!\u2014true knowledge, insight into appalling truth, preponderates\nover all motives inciting to action, in Hamlet as well as in the Dionysian\nman. No comfort avails any longer; his longing goes beyond a world after\ndeath, beyond the gods themselves; existence with its glittering reflection in\nthe gods, or in an immortal other world is abjured. In the consciousness of\nthe truth he has perceived, man now sees everywhere only the awfulness or the\nabsurdity of existence, he now understands the symbolism in the fate of\nOphelia, he now discerns the wisdom of the sylvan god Silenus: and loathing\nseizes him.\n\nHere, in this extremest danger of the will, _art_ approaches, as a saving and\nhealing enchantress; she alone is able to transform these nauseating\nreflections on the awfulness or absurdity of existence into representations\nwherewith it is possible to live: these are the representations of the\n_sublime_ as the artistic subjugation of the awful, and the _comic_ as the\nartistic delivery from the nausea of the absurd.

The\nsatyr was something sublime and godlike: he could not but appear so,\nespecially to the sad and wearied eye of the Dionysian man. He would have been\noffended by our spurious tricked-up shepherd, while his eye dwelt with sublime\nsatisfaction on the naked and unstuntedly magnificent characters of nature:\nhere the illusion of culture was brushed away from the archetype of man; here\nthe true man, the bearded satyr, revealed himself, who shouts joyfully to his\ngod. Before him the cultured man shrank to a lying caricature. Schiller is\nright also with reference to these beginnings of tragic art: the chorus is a\nliving bulwark against the onsets of reality, because it\u2014the satyric\nchorus\u2014portrays existence more truthfully, more realistically, more perfectly\nthan the cultured man who ordinarily considers himself as the only reality.\nThe sphere of poetry does not lie outside the world, like some fantastic\nimpossibility of a poet's imagination: it seeks to be the very opposite, the\nunvarnished expression of truth, and must for this very reason cast aside the\nfalse finery of that supposed reality of the cultured man. The contrast\nbetween this intrinsic truth of nature and the falsehood of culture, which\nposes as the only reality, is similar to that existing between the eternal\nkernel of things, the thing in itself, and the collective world of phenomena.\nAnd even as tragedy, with its metaphysical comfort, points to the eternal life\nof this kernel of existence, notwithstanding the perpetual dissolution of\nphenomena, so the symbolism of the satyric chorus already expresses\nfiguratively this primordial relation between the thing in itself and\nphenomenon. The idyllic shepherd of the modern man is but a copy of the sum of\nthe illusions of culture which he calls nature; the Dionysian Greek desires\ntruth and nature in their most potent form;\u2014he sees himself metamorphosed into\nthe satyr.\n\nThe revelling crowd of the votaries of Dionysus rejoices, swayed by such moods\nand perceptions, the power of which transforms them before their own eyes, so\nthat they imagine they behold themselves as reconstituted genii of nature, as\nsatyrs. The later constitution of the tragic chorus is the artistic imitation\nof this natural phenomenon, which of course required a separation of the\nDionysian spectators from the enchanted Dionysians. However, we must never\nlose sight of the fact that the public of the Attic tragedy rediscovered\nitself in the chorus of the orchestra, that there was in reality no antithesis\nof public and chorus: for all was but one great sublime chorus of dancing and\nsinging satyrs, or of such as allowed themselves to be represented by the\nsatyrs. The Schlegelian observation must here reveal itself to us in a deeper\nsense.

In their theatres the terraced structure of\nthe spectators' space rising in concentric arcs enabled every one, in the\nstrictest sense, to _overlook_ the entire world of culture around him, and in\nsurfeited contemplation to imagine himself a chorist. According to this view,\nthen, we may call the chorus in its primitive stage in proto-tragedy, a self-\nmirroring of the Dionysian man: a phenomenon which may be best exemplified by\nthe process of the actor, who, if he be truly gifted, sees hovering before his\neyes with almost tangible perceptibility the character he is to represent. The\nsatyric chorus is first of all a vision of the Dionysian throng, just as the\nworld of the stage is, in turn, a vision of the satyric chorus: the power of\nthis vision is great enough to render the eye dull and insensible to the\nimpression of \"reality,\" to the presence of the cultured men occupying the\ntiers of seats on every side. The form of the Greek theatre reminds one of a\nlonesome mountain-valley: the architecture of the scene appears like a\nluminous cloud-picture which the Bacchants swarming on the mountains behold\nfrom the heights, as the splendid encirclement in the midst of which the image\nof Dionysus is revealed to them.\n\nOwing to our learned conception of the elementary artistic processes, this\nartistic proto-phenomenon, which is here introduced to explain the tragic\nchorus, is almost shocking: while nothing can be more certain than that the\npoet is a poet only in that he beholds himself surrounded by forms which live\nand act before him, into the innermost being of which his glance penetrates.\nBy reason of a strange defeat in our capacities, we modern men are apt to\nrepresent to ourselves the \u00e6sthetic proto-phenomenon as too complex and\nabstract. For the true poet the metaphor is not a rhetorical figure, but a\nvicarious image which actually hovers before him in place of a concept. The\ncharacter is not for him an aggregate composed of a studied collection of\nparticular traits, but an irrepressibly live person appearing before his eyes,\nand differing only from the corresponding vision of the painter by its ever\ncontinued life and action. Why is it that Homer sketches much more\nvividly[[7]](491753352961627459_51356-h-2.htm.html#Footnote_7_9) than all the\nother poets? Because he\ncontemplates[[8]](491753352961627459_51356-h-2.htm.html#Footnote_8_10) much\nmore. We talk so abstractly about poetry, because we are all wont to be bad\npoets. At bottom the \u00e6sthetic phenomenon is simple: let a man but have the\nfaculty of perpetually seeing a lively play and of constantly living\nsurrounded by hosts of spirits, then he is a poet: let him but feel the\nimpulse to transform himself and to talk from out the bodies and souls of\nothers, then he is a dramatist.\n\nThe Dionysian excitement is able to impart to a whole mass of men this\nartistic faculty of seeing themselves surrounded by such a host of spirits,\nwith whom they know themselves to be inwardly one. This function of the tragic\nchorus is the _dramatic_ proto-phenomenon: to see one's self transformed\nbefore one's self, and then to act as if one had really entered into another\nbody, into another character. This function stands at the beginning of the\ndevelopment of the drama.

Here we have something different from the\nrhapsodist, who does not blend with his pictures, but only sees them, like the\npainter, with contemplative eye outside of him; here we actually have a\nsurrender of the individual by his entering into another nature. Moreover this\nphenomenon appears in the form of an epidemic: a whole throng feels itself\nmetamorphosed in this wise. Hence it is that the dithyramb is essentially\ndifferent from every other variety of the choric song. The virgins, who with\nlaurel twigs in their hands solemnly proceed to the temple of Apollo and sing\na processional hymn, remain what they are and retain their civic names: the\ndithyrambic chorus is a chorus of transformed beings, whose civic past and\nsocial rank are totally forgotten: they have become the timeless servants of\ntheir god that live aloof from all the spheres of society. Every other variety\nof the choric lyric of the Hellenes is but an enormous enhancement of the\nApollonian unit-singer: while in the dithyramb we have before us a community\nof unconscious actors, who mutually regard themselves as transformed among one\nanother.\n\nThis enchantment is the prerequisite of all dramatic art. In this enchantment\nthe Dionysian reveller sees himself as a satyr, _and as satyr he in turn\nbeholds the god,_ that is, in his transformation he sees a new vision outside\nhim as the Apollonian consummation of his state. With this new vision the\ndrama is complete.\n\nAccording to this view, we must understand Greek tragedy as the Dionysian\nchorus, which always disburdens itself anew in an Apollonian world of\npictures. The choric parts, therefore, with which tragedy is interlaced, are\nin a manner the mother-womb of the entire so-called dialogue, that is, of the\nwhole stage-world, of the drama proper. In several successive outbursts does\nthis primordial basis of tragedy beam forth the vision of the drama, which is\na dream-phenomenon throughout, and, as such, epic in character: on the other\nhand, however, as objectivation of a Dionysian state, it does not represent\nthe Apollonian redemption in appearance, but, conversely, the dissolution of\nthe individual and his unification with primordial existence. Accordingly, the\ndrama is the Apollonian embodiment of Dionysian perceptions and influences,\nand is thereby separated from the epic as by an immense gap.\n\nThe _chorus_ of Greek tragedy, the symbol of the mass of the people moved by\nDionysian excitement, is thus fully explained by our conception of it as here\nset forth. Whereas, being accustomed to the position of a chorus on the modern\nstage, especially an operatic chorus, we could never comprehend why the tragic\nchorus of the Greeks should be older, more primitive, indeed, more important\nthan the \"action\" proper,\u2014as has been so plainly declared by the voice of\ntradition; whereas, furthermore, we could not reconcile with this traditional\nparamount importance and primitiveness the fact of the chorus' being composed\nonly of humble, ministering beings; indeed, at first only of goatlike satyrs;\nwhereas, finally, the orchestra before the scene was always a riddle to us; we\nhave learned to comprehend at length that the scene, together with the action,\nwas fundamentally and originally conceived only as a _vision,_ that the only\nreality is just the chorus, which of itself generates the vision and speaks\nthereof with the entire symbolism of dancing, tone, and word. This chorus\nbeholds in the vision its lord and master Dionysus, and is thus for ever the\n_serving_ chorus: it sees how he, the god, suffers and glorifies himself, and\ntherefore does not itself _act_.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 132396, "end_char_idx": 136490, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c2ba9fec-d92c-4076-b5e1-889cd54deffe": {"__data__": {"id_": "c2ba9fec-d92c-4076-b5e1-889cd54deffe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11e7bbb4-f380-4d2a-b724-0bdf86b1b378", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "aeb08ac84a3c4636a7473de39f346a73d2a08999751ab3cf01bbab79f100626f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "63bf9429-35f9-4a06-ad16-e9ea07da35a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "b8107f71fe01ba152a84ee3f3a28130840614dc7541d2307c0ba23077540b2b4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "133e5955-f4ae-46c9-952b-3560a903238a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cd0f5a3d43421210d29345b7fa79f383fc6de7d439e92ba833d6193c4029f844", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "This chorus\nbeholds in the vision its lord and master Dionysus, and is thus for ever the\n_serving_ chorus: it sees how he, the god, suffers and glorifies himself, and\ntherefore does not itself _act_. But though its attitude towards the god is\nthroughout the attitude of ministration, this is nevertheless the highest\nexpression, the Dionysian expression of _Nature,_ and therefore, like Nature\nherself, the chorus utters oracles and wise sayings when transported with\nenthusiasm: as _fellow-sufferer_ it is also the _sage_ proclaiming truth from\nout the heart of Nature. Thus, then, originates the fantastic figure, which\nseems so shocking, of the wise and enthusiastic satyr, who is at the same time\n\"the dumb man\" in contrast to the god: the image of Nature and her strongest\nimpulses, yea, the symbol of Nature, and at the same time the herald of her\nart and wisdom: musician, poet, dancer, and visionary in one person.\n\nAgreeably to this view, and agreeably to tradition, _Dionysus,_ the proper\nstage-hero and focus of vision, is not at first actually present in the oldest\nperiod of tragedy, but is only imagined as present: _i.e.,_ tragedy is\noriginally only \"chorus\" and not \"drama.\" Later on the attempt is made to\nexhibit the god as real and to display the visionary figure together with its\nglorifying encirclement before the eyes of all; it is here that the \"drama\" in\nthe narrow sense of the term begins. To the dithyrambic chorus is now assigned\nthe task of exciting the minds of the hearers to such a pitch of Dionysian\nfrenzy, that, when the tragic hero appears on the stage, they do not behold in\nhim, say, the unshapely masked man, but a visionary figure, born as it were of\ntheir own ecstasy. Let us picture Admetes thinking in profound meditation of\nhis lately departed wife Alcestis, and quite consuming himself in spiritual\ncontemplation thereof\u2014when suddenly the veiled figure of a woman resembling\nher in form and gait is led towards him: let us picture his sudden trembling\nanxiety, his agitated comparisons, his instinctive conviction\u2014and we shall\nhave an analogon to the sensation with which the spectator, excited to\nDionysian frenzy, saw the god approaching on the stage, a god with whose\nsufferings he had already become identified. He involuntarily transferred the\nentire picture of the god, fluttering magically before his soul, to this\nmasked figure and resolved its reality as it were into a phantasmal unreality.\nThis is the Apollonian dream-state, in which the world of day is veiled, and a\nnew world, clearer, more intelligible, more striking than the former, and\nnevertheless more shadowy, is ever born anew in perpetual change before our\neyes. We accordingly recognise in tragedy a thorough-going stylistic contrast:\nthe language, colour, flexibility and dynamics of the dialogue fall apart in\nthe Dionysian lyrics of the chorus on the one hand, and in the Apollonian\ndream-world of the scene on the other, into entirely separate spheres of\nexpression. The Apollonian appearances, in which Dionysus objectifies himself,\nare no longer \"ein ewiges Meer, ein wechselnd Weben, ein gl\u00fchend\nLeben,\"[[9]](491753352961627459_51356-h-2.htm.html#Footnote_9_11) as is the\nmusic of the chorus, they are no longer the forces merely felt, but not\ncondensed into a picture, by which the inspired votary of Dionysus divines the\nproximity of his god: the clearness and firmness of epic form now speak to him\nfrom the scene, Dionysus now no longer speaks through forces, but as an epic\nhero, almost in the language of Homer.\n\n[[5]](491753352961627459_51356-h-2.htm.html#FNanchor_5_7) Zuschauer.\n\n[[6]](491753352961627459_51356-h-2.htm.html#FNanchor_6_8) Schauer.\n\n[[7]](491753352961627459_51356-h-2.htm.html#FNanchor_7_9) Anschaulicher.\n\n[[8]](491753352961627459_51356-h-2.htm.html#FNanchor_8_10) Anschaut.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 136291, "end_char_idx": 140117, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "133e5955-f4ae-46c9-952b-3560a903238a": {"__data__": {"id_": "133e5955-f4ae-46c9-952b-3560a903238a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11e7bbb4-f380-4d2a-b724-0bdf86b1b378", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "aeb08ac84a3c4636a7473de39f346a73d2a08999751ab3cf01bbab79f100626f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c2ba9fec-d92c-4076-b5e1-889cd54deffe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "8426cd6167fa2ed796722a605bca769533e31bed65e1403a4f6e3885480f0d17", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "278cd4d6-32f9-4aa8-b644-f3688e75e558", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "86c712b22095785a609bbee5052b2e17e70b62dcf8c38226615925b7fdd6f626", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "[[5]](491753352961627459_51356-h-2.htm.html#FNanchor_5_7) Zuschauer.\n\n[[6]](491753352961627459_51356-h-2.htm.html#FNanchor_6_8) Schauer.\n\n[[7]](491753352961627459_51356-h-2.htm.html#FNanchor_7_9) Anschaulicher.\n\n[[8]](491753352961627459_51356-h-2.htm.html#FNanchor_8_10) Anschaut.\n\n[[9]](491753352961627459_51356-h-2.htm.html#FNanchor_9_11) An eternal sea, A\nweaving, flowing, Life, all glowing. _Faust,_ trans. of Bayard Taylor.\u2014TR.\n\n#### 9.\n\nWhatever rises to the surface in the dialogue of the Apollonian part of Greek\ntragedy, appears simple, transparent, beautiful. In this sense the dialogue is\na copy of the Hellene, whose nature reveals itself in the dance, because in\nthe dance the greatest energy is merely potential, but betrays itself\nnevertheless in flexible and vivacious movements. The language of the\nSophoclean heroes, for instance, surprises us by its Apollonian precision and\nclearness, so that we at once imagine we see into the innermost recesses of\ntheir being, and marvel not a little that the way to these recesses is so\nshort. But if for the moment we disregard the character of the hero which\nrises to the surface and grows visible\u2014and which at bottom is nothing but the\nlight-picture cast on a dark wall, that is, appearance through and through,\u2014if\nrather we enter into the myth which projects itself in these bright\nmirrorings, we shall of a sudden experience a phenomenon which bears a reverse\nrelation to one familiar in optics. When, after a vigorous effort to gaze into\nthe sun, we turn away blinded, we have dark-coloured spots before our eyes as\nrestoratives, so to speak; while, on the contrary, those light-picture\nphenomena of the Sophoclean hero,\u2014in short, the Apollonian of the mask,\u2014are\nthe necessary productions of a glance into the secret and terrible things of\nnature, as it were shining spots to heal the eye which dire night has seared.\nOnly in this sense can we hope to be able to grasp the true meaning of the\nserious and significant notion of \"Greek cheerfulness\"; while of course we\nencounter the misunderstood notion of this cheerfulness, as resulting from a\nstate of unendangered comfort, on all the ways and paths of the present time.\n\nThe most sorrowful figure of the Greek stage, the hapless _\u0152dipus,_ was\nunderstood by Sophocles as the noble man, who in spite of his wisdom was\ndestined to error and misery, but nevertheless through his extraordinary\nsufferings ultimately exerted a magical, wholesome influence on all around\nhim, which continues effective even after his death. The noble man does not\nsin; this is what the thoughtful poet wishes to tell us: all laws, all natural\norder, yea, the moral world itself, may be destroyed through his action, but\nthrough this very action a higher magic circle of influences is brought into\nplay, which establish a new world on the ruins of the old that has been\noverthrown. This is what the poet, in so far as he is at the same time a\nreligious thinker, wishes to tell us: as poet, he shows us first of all a\nwonderfully complicated legal mystery, which the judge slowly unravels, link\nby link, to his own destruction. The truly Hellenic delight at this\ndialectical loosening is so great, that a touch of surpassing cheerfulness is\nthereby communicated to the entire play, which everywhere blunts the edge of\nthe horrible presuppositions of the procedure. In the \"\u0152dipus at Colonus\" we\nfind the same cheerfulness, elevated, however, to an infinite transfiguration:\nin contrast to the aged king, subjected to an excess of misery, and exposed\nsolely as a _sufferer_ to all that befalls him, we have here a supermundane\ncheerfulness, which descends from a divine sphere and intimates to us that in\nhis purely passive attitude the hero attains his highest activity, the\ninfluence of which extends far beyond his life, while his earlier conscious\nmusing and striving led him only to passivity.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 139837, "end_char_idx": 143725, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "278cd4d6-32f9-4aa8-b644-f3688e75e558": {"__data__": {"id_": "278cd4d6-32f9-4aa8-b644-f3688e75e558", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11e7bbb4-f380-4d2a-b724-0bdf86b1b378", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "aeb08ac84a3c4636a7473de39f346a73d2a08999751ab3cf01bbab79f100626f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "133e5955-f4ae-46c9-952b-3560a903238a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "2ff086bdf3246ad74cefb6d54fb1d3f57284697fd293d112d68c32c84578eb7e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "da2b2272-1e55-4d8e-8ffc-4ab736ae99e4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2528ed2d0ddba76be4ff37adc4954ee7abcb2844942a2a585bd7fbf538478cbb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The truly Hellenic delight at this\ndialectical loosening is so great, that a touch of surpassing cheerfulness is\nthereby communicated to the entire play, which everywhere blunts the edge of\nthe horrible presuppositions of the procedure.

Thus, then, the legal knot of\nthe fable of \u0152dipus, which to mortal eyes appears indissolubly entangled, is\nslowly unravelled\u2014and the profoundest human joy comes upon us in the presence\nof this divine counterpart of dialectics. If this explanation does justice to\nthe poet, it may still be asked whether the substance of the myth is thereby\nexhausted; and here it turns out that the entire conception of the poet is\nnothing but the light-picture which healing nature holds up to us after a\nglance into the abyss. \u0152dipus, the murderer of his father, the husband of his\nmother, \u0152dipus, the interpreter of the riddle of the Sphinx! What does the\nmysterious triad of these deeds of destiny tell us? There is a primitive\npopular belief, especially in Persia, that a wise Magian can be born only of\nincest: which we have forthwith to interpret to ourselves with reference to\nthe riddle-solving and mother-marrying \u0152dipus, to the effect that when the\nboundary of the present and future, the rigid law of individuation and, in\ngeneral, the intrinsic spell of nature, are broken by prophetic and magical\npowers, an extraordinary counter-naturalness\u2014as, in this case, incest\u2014must\nhave preceded as a cause; for how else could one force nature to surrender her\nsecrets but by victoriously opposing her, _i.e.,_ by means of the Unnatural?\nIt is this intuition which I see imprinted in the awful triad of the destiny\nof \u0152dipus: the very man who solves the riddle of nature\u2014that double-\nconstituted Sphinx\u2014must also, as the murderer of his father and husband of his\nmother, break the holiest laws of nature. Indeed, it seems as if the myth\nsought to whisper into our ears that wisdom, especially Dionysian wisdom, is\nan unnatural abomination, and that whoever, through his knowledge, plunges\nnature into an abyss of annihilation, must also experience the dissolution of\nnature in himself. \"The sharpness of wisdom turns round upon the sage: wisdom\nis a crime against nature\": such terrible expressions does the myth call out\nto us: but the Hellenic poet touches like a sunbeam the sublime and formidable\nMemnonian statue of the myth, so that it suddenly begins to sound\u2014in\nSophoclean melodies.\n\nWith the glory of passivity I now contrast the glory of activity which\nilluminates the _Prometheus_ of \u00c6schylus.

What is\nmost wonderful, however, in this Promethean form, which according to its\nfundamental conception is the specific hymn of impiety, is the profound\n\u00c6schylean yearning for _justice_ : the untold sorrow of the bold \"single-\nhanded being\" on the one hand, and the divine need, ay, the foreboding of a\ntwilight of the gods, on the other, the power of these two worlds of suffering\nconstraining to reconciliation, to metaphysical oneness\u2014all this suggests most\nforcibly the central and main position of the \u00c6schylean view of things, which\nsees Moira as eternal justice enthroned above gods and men. In view of the\nastonishing boldness with which \u00c6schylus places the Olympian world on his\nscales of justice, it must be remembered that the deep-minded Greek had an\nimmovably firm substratum of metaphysical thought in his mysteries, and that\nall his sceptical paroxysms could be discharged upon the Olympians. With\nreference to these deities, the Greek artist, in particular, had an obscure\nfeeling as to mutual dependency: and it is just in the Prometheus of \u00c6schylus\nthat this feeling is symbolised. The Titanic artist found in himself the\ndaring belief that he could create men and at least destroy Olympian deities:\nnamely, by his superior wisdom, for which, to be sure, he had to atone by\neternal suffering. The splendid \"can-ing\" of the great genius, bought too\ncheaply even at the price of eternal suffering, the stern pride of the\n_artist_ : this is the essence and soul of \u00c6schylean poetry, while Sophocles\nin his \u0152dipus preludingly strikes up the victory-song of the _saint_. But even\nthis interpretation which \u00c6schylus has given to the myth does not fathom its\nastounding depth of terror; the fact is rather that the artist's delight in\nunfolding, the cheerfulness of artistic creating bidding defiance to all\ncalamity, is but a shining stellar and nebular image reflected in a black sea\nof sadness. The tale of Prometheus is an original possession of the entire\nAryan family of races, and documentary evidence of their capacity for the\nprofoundly tragic; indeed, it is not improbable that this myth has the same\ncharacteristic significance for the Aryan race that the myth of the fall of\nman has for the Semitic, and that there is a relationship between the two\nmyths like that of brother and sister. The presupposition of the Promethean\nmyth is the transcendent value which a na\u00efve humanity attach to _fire_ as the\ntrue palladium of every ascending culture: that man, however, should dispose\nat will of this fire, and should not receive it only as a gift from heaven, as\nthe igniting lightning or the warming solar flame, appeared to the\ncontemplative primordial men as crime and robbery of the divine nature.

What distinguishes the Aryan\nrepresentation is the sublime view of _active sin_ as the properly Promethean\nvirtue, which suggests at the same time the ethical basis of pessimistic\ntragedy as the _justification_ of human evil\u2014of human guilt as well as of the\nsuffering incurred thereby.

The one truly\nreal Dionysus appears in a multiplicity of forms, in the mask of a fighting\nhero and entangled, as it were, in the net of an individual will. As the\nvisibly appearing god now talks and acts, he resembles an erring, striving,\nsuffering individual: and that, in general, he _appears_ with such epic\nprecision and clearness, is due to the dream-reading Apollo, who reads to the\nchorus its Dionysian state through this symbolic appearance. In reality,\nhowever, this hero is the suffering Dionysus of the mysteries, a god\nexperiencing in himself the sufferings of individuation, of whom wonderful\nmyths tell that as a boy he was dismembered by the Titans and has been\nworshipped in this state as\nZagreus:[[15]](491753352961627459_51356-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_15_17) whereby\nis intimated that this dismemberment, the properly Dionysian _suffering,_ is\nlike a transformation into air, water, earth, and fire, that we must therefore\nregard the state of individuation as the source and primal cause of all\nsuffering, as something objectionable in itself. From the smile of this\nDionysus sprang the Olympian gods, from his tears sprang man. In his existence\nas a dismembered god, Dionysus has the dual nature of a cruel barbarised\ndemon, and a mild pacific ruler. But the hope of the epopts looked for a new\nbirth of Dionysus, which we have now to conceive of in anticipation as the end\nof individuation: it was for this coming third Dionysus that the stormy\njubilation-hymns of the epopts resounded. And it is only this hope that sheds\na ray of joy upon the features of a world torn asunder and shattered into\nindividuals: as is symbolised in the myth by Demeter sunk in eternal sadness,\nwho _rejoices_ again only when told that she may _once more_ give birth to\nDionysus In the views of things here given we already have all the elements of\na profound and pessimistic contemplation of the world, and along with these we\nhave the _mystery doctrine of tragedy_ : the fundamental knowledge of the\noneness of all existing things, the consideration of individuation as the\nprimal cause of evil, and art as the joyous hope that the spell of\nindividuation may be broken, as the augury of a restored oneness.\n\nIt has already been intimated that the Homeric epos is the poem of Olympian\nculture, wherewith this culture has sung its own song of triumph over the\nterrors of the war of the Titans. Under the predominating influence of tragic\npoetry, these Homeric myths are now reproduced anew, and show by this\nmetempsychosis that meantime the Olympian culture also has been vanquished by\na still deeper view of things. The haughty Titan Prometheus has announced to\nhis Olympian tormentor that the extremest danger will one day menace his rule,\nunless he ally with him betimes. In \u00c6schylus we perceive the terrified Zeus,\napprehensive of his end, in alliance with the Titan. Thus, the former age of\nthe Titans is subsequently brought from Tartarus once more to the light of\nday.

Dionysian\ntruth takes over the entire domain of myth as symbolism of _its_ knowledge,\nwhich it makes known partly in the public cult of tragedy and partly in the\nsecret celebration of the dramatic mysteries, always, however, in the old\nmythical garb. What was the power, which freed Prometheus from his vultures\nand transformed the myth into a vehicle of Dionysian wisdom? It is the\nHeracleian power of music: which, having reached its highest manifestness in\ntragedy, can invest myths with a new and most profound significance, which we\nhave already had occasion to characterise as the most powerful faculty of\nmusic. For it is the fate of every myth to insinuate itself into the narrow\nlimits of some alleged historical reality, and to be treated by some later\ngeneration as a solitary fact with historical claims: and the Greeks were\nalready fairly on the way to restamp the whole of their mythical juvenile\ndream sagaciously and arbitrarily into a historico-pragmatical _juvenile\nhistory._ For this is the manner in which religions are wont to die out: when\nof course under the stern, intelligent eyes of an orthodox dogmatism, the\nmythical presuppositions of a religion are systematised as a completed sum of\nhistorical events, and when one begins apprehensively to defend the\ncredibility of the myth, while at the same time opposing all continuation of\ntheir natural vitality and luxuriance; when, accordingly, the feeling for myth\ndies out, and its place is taken by the claim of religion to historical\nfoundations. This dying myth was now seized by the new-born genius of\nDionysian music, in whose hands it bloomed once more, with such colours as it\nhad never yet displayed, with a fragrance that awakened a longing anticipation\nof a metaphysical world. After this final effulgence it collapses, its leaves\nwither, and soon the scoffing Lucians of antiquity catch at the discoloured\nand faded flowers which the winds carry off in every direction. Through\ntragedy the myth attains its profoundest significance, its most expressive\nform; it rises once more like a wounded hero, and the whole surplus of\nvitality, together with the philosophical calmness of the Dying, burns in its\neyes with a last powerful gleam.\n\nWhat meantest thou, oh impious Euripides, in seeking once more to enthral this\ndying one? It died under thy ruthless hands: and then thou madest use of\ncounterfeit, masked myth, which like the ape of Heracles could only trick\nitself out in the old finery. And as myth died in thy hands, so also died the\ngenius of music; though thou couldst covetously plunder all the gardens of\nmusic\u2014thou didst only realise a counterfeit, masked music. And because thou\nhast forsaken Dionysus. Apollo hath also forsaken thee; rout up all the\npassions from their haunts and conjure them into thy sphere, sharpen and\npolish a sophistical dialectics for the speeches of thy heroes\u2014thy very heroes\nhave only counterfeit, masked passions, and speak only counterfeit, masked\nmusic.\n\n[[15]](491753352961627459_51356-h-3.htm.html#FNanchor_15_17) See article by\nMr. Arthur Symons in _The Academy,_ 30th August 1902.\n\n[[16]](491753352961627459_51356-h-3.htm.html#FNanchor_16_18) Die m\u00e4chtige\nFaust.\u2014Cf. _Faust,_ Chorus of Spirits.\u2014TR.\n\n#### 11.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 158159, "end_char_idx": 162120, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e876e274-4a02-4d4e-b23c-bc77907959ad": {"__data__": {"id_": "e876e274-4a02-4d4e-b23c-bc77907959ad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11e7bbb4-f380-4d2a-b724-0bdf86b1b378", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "aeb08ac84a3c4636a7473de39f346a73d2a08999751ab3cf01bbab79f100626f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "69ddb863-f2b7-4e30-aae4-b327da753be1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "f65cb9d77ec909c9a71fa15b5cbc44a9ea5235234b452e8d8bcb38d74d6e6777", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1a972b18-fee4-4799-a2f8-1e97cc2c163f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0f8ef077d0df062011dd4f3d72499085f8850b5ffb7fdf2ed53190b3a69d9c2b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "And because thou\nhast forsaken Dionysus.

For if it be in accordance with a happy state of things to\ndepart this life without a struggle, leaving behind a fair posterity, the\nclosing period of these older arts exhibits such a happy state of things:\nslowly they sink out of sight, and before their dying eyes already stand their\nfairer progeny, who impatiently lift up their heads with courageous mien. The\ndeath of Greek tragedy, on the other hand, left an immense void, deeply felt\neverywhere. Even as certain Greek sailors in the time of Tiberius once heard\nupon a lonesome island the thrilling cry, \"great Pan is dead\": so now as it\nwere sorrowful wailing sounded through the Hellenic world: \"Tragedy is dead!\nPoetry itself has perished with her! Begone, begone, ye stunted, emaciated\nepigones! Begone to Hades, that ye may for once eat your fill of the crumbs of\nyour former masters!\"\n\nBut when after all a new Art blossomed forth which revered tragedy as her\nancestress and mistress, it was observed with horror that she did indeed bear\nthe features of her mother, but those very features the latter had exhibited\nin her long death-struggle. It was _Euripides_ who fought this death-struggle\nof tragedy; the later art is known as the _New Attic Comedy._ In it the\ndegenerate form of tragedy lived on as a monument of the most painful and\nviolent death of tragedy proper.\n\nThis connection between the two serves to explain the passionate attachment to\nEuripides evinced by the poets of the New Comedy, and hence we are no longer\nsurprised at the wish of Philemon, who would have got himself hanged at once,\nwith the sole design of being able to visit Euripides in the lower regions: if\nonly he could be assured generally that the deceased still had his wits. But\nif we desire, as briefly as possible, and without professing to say aught\nexhaustive on the subject, to characterise what Euripides has in common with\nMenander and Philemon, and what appealed to them so strongly as worthy of\nimitation: it will suffice to say that the _spectator_ was brought upon the\nstage by Euripides. He who has perceived the material of which the Promethean\ntragic writers prior to Euripides formed their heroes, and how remote from\ntheir purpose it was to bring the true mask of reality on the stage, will also\nknow what to make of the wholly divergent tendency of Euripides. Through him\nthe commonplace individual forced his way from the spectators' benches to the\nstage itself; the mirror in which formerly only great and bold traits found\nexpression now showed the painful exactness that conscientiously reproduces\neven the abortive lines of nature.

The spectator\nnow virtually saw and heard his double on the Euripidean stage, and rejoiced\nthat he could talk so well. But this joy was not all: one even learned of\nEuripides how to speak: he prides himself upon this in his contest with\n\u00c6schylus: how the people have learned from him how to observe, debate, and\ndraw conclusions according to the rules of art and with the cleverest\nsophistications. In general it may be said that through this revolution of the\npopular language he made the New Comedy possible. For it was henceforth no\nlonger a secret, how\u2014and with what saws\u2014the commonplace could represent and\nexpress itself on the stage. Civic mediocrity, on which Euripides built all\nhis political hopes, was now suffered to speak, while heretofore the demigod\nin tragedy and the drunken satyr, or demiman, in comedy, had determined the\ncharacter of the language. And so the Aristophanean Euripides prides himself\non having portrayed the common, familiar, everyday life and dealings of the\npeople, concerning which all are qualified to pass judgment. If now the entire\npopulace philosophises, manages land and goods with unheard-of circumspection,\nand conducts law-suits, he takes all the credit to himself, and glories in the\nsplendid results of the wisdom with which he inoculated the rabble.\n\nIt was to a populace prepared and enlightened in this manner that the New\nComedy could now address itself, of which Euripides had become as it were the\nchorus-master; only that in this case the chorus of spectators had to be\ntrained. As soon as this chorus was trained to sing in the Euripidean key,\nthere arose that chesslike variety of the drama, the New Comedy, with its\nperpetual triumphs of cunning and artfulness. But Euripides\u2014the chorus-\nmaster\u2014was praised incessantly: indeed, people would have killed themselves in\norder to learn yet more from him, had they not known that tragic poets were\nquite as dead as tragedy. But with it the Hellene had surrendered the belief\nin his immortality; not only the belief in an ideal past, but also the belief\nin an ideal future.

And we must ascribe it to its influence\nthat the conception of Greek antiquity, which lived on for centuries,\npreserved with almost enduring persistency that peculiar hectic colour of\ncheerfulness\u2014as if there had never been a Sixth Century with its birth of\ntragedy, its Mysteries, its Pythagoras and Heraclitus, indeed as if the art-\nworks of that great period did not at all exist, which in fact\u2014each by\nitself\u2014can in no wise be explained as having sprung from the soil of such a\ndecrepit and slavish love of existence and cheerfulness, and point to an\naltogether different conception of things as their source.\n\nThe assertion made a moment ago, that Euripides introduced the spectator on\nthe stage to qualify him the better to pass judgment on the drama, will make\nit appear as if the old tragic art was always in a false relation to the\nspectator: and one would be tempted to extol the radical tendency of Euripides\nto bring about an adequate relation between art-work and public as an advance\non Sophocles. But, as things are, \"public\" is merely a word, and not at all a\nhomogeneous and constant quantity. Why should the artist be under obligations\nto accommodate himself to a power whose strength is merely in numbers? And if\nby virtue of his endowments and aspirations he feels himself superior to every\none of these spectators, how could he feel greater respect for the collective\nexpression of all these subordinate capacities than for the relatively\nhighest-endowed individual spectator? In truth, if ever a Greek artist treated\nhis public throughout a long life with presumptuousness and self-sufficiency,\nit was Euripides, who, even when the masses threw themselves at his feet, with\nsublime defiance made an open assault on his own tendency, the very tendency\nwith which he had triumphed over the masses. If this genius had had the\nslightest reverence for the pandemonium of the public, he would have broken\ndown long before the middle of his career beneath the weighty blows of his own\nfailures. These considerations here make it obvious that our formula\u2014namely,\nthat Euripides brought the spectator upon the stage, in order to make him\ntruly competent to pass judgment\u2014was but a provisional one, and that we must\nseek for a deeper understanding of his tendency. Conversely, it is undoubtedly\nwell known that \u00c6schylus and Sophocles, during all their lives, indeed, far\nbeyond their lives, enjoyed the full favour of the people, and that therefore\nin the case of these predecessors of Euripides the idea of a false relation\nbetween art-work and public was altogether excluded. What was it that thus\nforcibly diverted this highly gifted artist, so incessantly impelled to\nproduction, from the path over which shone the sun of the greatest names in\npoetry and the cloudless heaven of popular favour?

How could he, owing to too\nmuch respect for the public \u2014dis-respect the public?\n\nEuripides\u2014and this is the solution of the riddle just propounded\u2014felt himself,\nas a poet, undoubtedly superior to the masses, but not to two of his\nspectators: he brought the masses upon the stage; these two spectators he\nrevered as the only competent judges and masters of his art: in compliance\nwith their directions and admonitions, he transferred the entire world of\nsentiments, passions, and experiences, hitherto present at every festival\nrepresentation as the invisible chorus on the spectators' benches, into the\nsouls of his stage-heroes; he yielded to their demands when he also sought for\nthese new characters the new word and the new tone; in their voices alone he\nheard the conclusive verdict on his work, as also the cheering promise of\ntriumph when he found himself condemned as usual by the justice of the public.\n\nOf these two, spectators the one is\u2014Euripides himself, Euripides _as thinker,_\nnot as poet. It might be said of him, that his unusually large fund of\ncritical ability, as in the case of Lessing, if it did not create, at least\nconstantly fructified a productively artistic collateral impulse. With this\nfaculty, with all the clearness and dexterity of his critical thought,\nEuripides had sat in the theatre and striven to recognise in the masterpieces\nof his great predecessors, as in faded paintings, feature and feature, line\nand line. And here had happened to him what one initiated in the deeper arcana\nof \u00c6schylean tragedy must needs have expected: he observed something\nincommensurable in every feature and in every line, a certain deceptive\ndistinctness and at the same time an enigmatic profundity, yea an infinitude,\nof background. Even the clearest figure had always a comet's tail attached to\nit, which seemed to suggest the uncertain and the inexplicable. The same\ntwilight shrouded the structure of the drama, especially the significance of\nthe chorus. And how doubtful seemed the solution of the ethical problems to\nhis mind! How questionable the treatment of the myths! How unequal the\ndistribution of happiness and misfortune! Even in the language of the Old\nTragedy there was much that was objectionable to him, or at least enigmatical;\nhe found especially too much pomp for simple affairs, too many tropes and\nimmense things for the plainness of the characters. Thus he sat restlessly\npondering in the theatre, and as a spectator he acknowledged to himself that\nhe did not understand his great predecessors. If, however, he thought the\nunderstanding the root proper of all enjoyment and productivity, he had to\ninquire and look about to see whether any one else thought as he did, and also\nacknowledged this incommensurability. But most people, and among them the best\nindividuals, had only a distrustful smile for him, while none could explain\nwhy the great masters were still in the right in face of his scruples and\nobjections. And in this painful condition he found _that other spectator,_ who\ndid not comprehend, and therefore did not esteem, tragedy.

Let us think of\nour own astonishment at the _chorus_ and the _tragic hero_ of that type of\ntragedy, neither of which we could reconcile with our practices any more than\nwith tradition\u2014till we rediscovered this duplexity itself as the origin and\nessence of Greek tragedy, as the expression of two interwoven artistic\nimpulses, _the Apollonian and the Dionysian_.\n\nTo separate this primitive and all-powerful Dionysian element from tragedy,\nand to build up a new and purified form of tragedy on the basis of a non-\nDionysian art, morality, and conception of things\u2014such is the tendency of\nEuripides which now reveals itself to us in a clear light.\n\nIn a myth composed in the eve of his life, Euripides himself most urgently\npropounded to his contemporaries the question as to the value and\nsignification of this tendency. Is the Dionysian entitled to exist at all?\nShould it not be forcibly rooted out of the Hellenic soil? Certainly, the poet\ntells us, if only it were possible: but the god Dionysus is too powerful; his\nmost intelligent adversary\u2014like Pentheus in the \"Bacch\u00e6\"\u2014is unwittingly\nenchanted by him, and in this enchantment meets his fate. The judgment of the\ntwo old sages, Cadmus and Tiresias, seems to be also the judgment of the aged\npoet: that the reflection of the wisest individuals does not overthrow old\npopular traditions, nor the perpetually propagating worship of Dionysus, that\nin fact it behoves us to display at least a diplomatically cautious concern in\nthe presence of such strange forces: where however it is always possible that\nthe god may take offence at such lukewarm participation, and finally change\nthe diplomat\u2014in this case Cadmus\u2014into a dragon. This is what a poet tells us,\nwho opposed Dionysus with heroic valour throughout a long life\u2014in order\nfinally to wind up his career with a glorification of his adversary, and with\nsuicide, like one staggering from giddiness, who, in order to escape the\nhorrible vertigo he can no longer endure, casts himself from a tower. This\ntragedy\u2014the Bacch\u00e6\u2014is a protest against the practicability of his own\ntendency; alas, and it has already been put into practice! The surprising\nthing had happened: when the poet recanted, his tendency had already\nconquered. Dionysus had already been scared from the tragic stage, and in fact\nby a demonic power which spoke through Euripides. Even Euripides was, in a\ncertain sense, only a mask: the deity that spoke through him was neither\nDionysus nor Apollo, but an altogether new-born demon, called _Socrates._ This\nis the new antithesis: the Dionysian and the Socratic, and the art-work of\nGreek tragedy was wrecked on it.

And even that Euripides has been\nchanged into a dragon as a punishment by the art-critics of all ages\u2014who could\nbe content with this wretched compensation?\n\nLet us now approach this _Socratic_ tendency with which Euripides combated and\nvanquished \u00c6schylean tragedy.\n\nWe must now ask ourselves, what could be the ulterior aim of the Euripidean\ndesign, which, in the highest ideality of its execution, would found drama\nexclusively on the non-Dionysian? What other form of drama could there be, if\nit was not to be born of the womb of music, in the mysterious twilight of the\nDionysian? Only _the dramatised epos:_ in which Apollonian domain of art the\n_tragic_ effect is of course unattainable. It does not depend on the subject-\nmatter of the events here represented; indeed, I venture to assert that it\nwould have been impossible for Goethe in his projected \"Nausikaa\" to have\nrendered tragically effective the suicide of the idyllic being with which he\nintended to complete the fifth act; so extraordinary is the power of the epic-\nApollonian representation, that it charms, before our eyes, the most terrible\nthings by the joy in appearance and in redemption through appearance. The poet\nof the dramatised epos cannot completely blend with his pictures any more than\nthe epic rhapsodist. He is still just the calm, unmoved embodiment of\nContemplation whose wide eyes see the picture _before_ them. The actor in this\ndramatised epos still remains intrinsically rhapsodist: the consecration of\ninner dreaming is on all his actions, so that he is never wholly an actor.\n\nHow, then, is the Euripidean play related to this ideal of the Apollonian\ndrama? Just as the younger rhapsodist is related to the solemn rhapsodist of\nthe old time. The former describes his own character in the Platonic \"Ion\" as\nfollows: \"When I am saying anything sad, my eyes fill with tears; when,\nhowever, what I am saying is awful and terrible, then my hair stands on end\nthrough fear, and my heart leaps.\" Here we no longer observe anything of the\nepic absorption in appearance, or of the unemotional coolness of the true\nactor, who precisely in his highest activity is wholly appearance and joy in\nappearance. Euripides is the actor with leaping heart, with hair standing on\nend; as Socratic thinker he designs the plan, as passionate actor he executes\nit. Neither in the designing nor in the execution is he an artist pure and\nsimple. And so the Euripidean drama is a thing both cool and fiery, equally\ncapable of freezing and burning; it is impossible for it to attain the\nApollonian, effect of the epos, while, on the other hand, it has severed\nitself as much as possible from Dionysian elements, and now, in order to act\nat all, it requires new stimulants, which can no longer lie within the sphere\nof the two unique art-impulses, the Apollonian and the Dionysian. The\nstimulants are cool, paradoxical _thoughts_ , in place of Apollonian\nintuitions\u2014and fiery _passions_ \u2014in place Dionysean ecstasies; and in fact,\nthoughts and passions very realistically copied, and not at all steeped in the\nether of art.\n\nAccordingly, if we have perceived this much, that Euripides did not succeed in\nestablishing the drama exclusively on the Apollonian, but that rather his non-\nDionysian inclinations deviated into a naturalistic and inartistic tendency,\nwe shall now be able to approach nearer to the character _\u00e6sthetic Socratism._\nsupreme law of which reads about as follows: \"to be beautiful everything must\nbe intelligible,\" as the parallel to the Socratic proposition, \"only the\nknowing is one virtuous.\"", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 177408, "end_char_idx": 181229, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6d3a281d-699d-4260-8fd2-0de42be2044c": {"__data__": {"id_": "6d3a281d-699d-4260-8fd2-0de42be2044c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11e7bbb4-f380-4d2a-b724-0bdf86b1b378", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "aeb08ac84a3c4636a7473de39f346a73d2a08999751ab3cf01bbab79f100626f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3bceac78-d178-4ba1-985d-1f5ca63f504a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "243d97968a57a1066083a210777284608cc7153507de6acd9788d09c68e9c5e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1415e883-52d7-4c0b-a0df-c602d07cf6ff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5d42472bf7df4b8ed5fb9fbaaac21714229ae031a3a52cd5349ad0e7c7c28736", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The\nstimulants are cool, paradoxical _thoughts_ , in place of Apollonian\nintuitions\u2014and fiery _passions_ \u2014in place Dionysean ecstasies; and in fact,\nthoughts and passions very realistically copied, and not at all steeped in the\nether of art.\n\nAccordingly, if we have perceived this much, that Euripides did not succeed in\nestablishing the drama exclusively on the Apollonian, but that rather his non-\nDionysian inclinations deviated into a naturalistic and inartistic tendency,\nwe shall now be able to approach nearer to the character _\u00e6sthetic Socratism._\nsupreme law of which reads about as follows: \"to be beautiful everything must\nbe intelligible,\" as the parallel to the Socratic proposition, \"only the\nknowing is one virtuous.\" With this canon in his hands Euripides measured all\nthe separate elements of the drama, and rectified them according to his\nprinciple: the language, the characters, the dramaturgic structure, and the\nchoric music. The poetic deficiency and retrogression, which we are so often\nwont to impute to Euripides in comparison with Sophoclean tragedy, is for the\nmost part the product of this penetrating critical process, this daring\nintelligibility. The Euripidian _prologue_ may serve us as an example of the\nproductivity of this, rationalistic method. Nothing could be more opposed to\nthe technique of our stage than the prologue in the drama of Euripides. For a\nsingle person to appear at the outset of the play telling us who he is, what\nprecedes the action, what has happened thus far, yea, what will happen in the\ncourse of the play, would be designated by a modern playwright as a wanton and\nunpardonable abandonment of the effect of suspense. Everything that is about\nto happen is known beforehand; who then cares to wait for it actually to\nhappen?\u2014considering, moreover, that here there is not by any means the\nexciting relation of a predicting dream to a reality taking place later on.\nEuripides speculated quite differently. The effect of tragedy never depended\non epic suspense, on the fascinating uncertainty as to what is to happen now\nand afterwards: but rather on the great rhetoro-lyric scenes in which the\npassion and dialectics of the chief hero swelled to a broad and mighty stream.\nEverything was arranged for pathos, not for action: and whatever was not\narranged for pathos was regarded as objectionable. But what interferes most\nwith the hearer's pleasurable satisfaction in such scenes is a missing link, a\ngap in the texture of the previous history. So long as the spectator has to\ndivine the meaning of this or that person, or the presuppositions of this or\nthat conflict of inclinations and intentions, his complete absorption in the\ndoings and sufferings of the chief persons is impossible, as is likewise\nbreathless fellow-feeling and fellow-fearing. The \u00c6schyleo-Sophoclean tragedy\nemployed the most ingenious devices in the first scenes to place in the hands\nof the spectator as if by chance all the threads requisite for understanding\nthe whole: a trait in which that noble artistry is approved, which as it were\nmasks the _inevitably_ formal, and causes it to appear as something\naccidental. But nevertheless Euripides thought he observed that during these\nfirst scenes the spectator was in a strange state of anxiety to make out the\nproblem of the previous history, so that the poetic beauties and pathos of the\nexposition were lost to him. Accordingly he placed the prologue even before\nthe exposition, and put it in the mouth of a person who could be trusted: some\ndeity had often as it were to guarantee the particulars of the tragedy to the\npublic and remove every doubt as to the reality of the myth: as in the case of\nDescartes, who could only prove the reality of the empiric world by an appeal\nto the truthfulness of God and His inability to utter falsehood. Euripides\nmakes use of the same divine truthfulness once more at the close of his drama,\nin order to ensure to the public the future of his heroes; this is the task of\nthe notorious _deus ex machina._ Between the preliminary and the additional\nepic spectacle there is the dramatico-lyric present, the \"drama\" proper.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 180496, "end_char_idx": 184641, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1415e883-52d7-4c0b-a0df-c602d07cf6ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "1415e883-52d7-4c0b-a0df-c602d07cf6ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11e7bbb4-f380-4d2a-b724-0bdf86b1b378", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "aeb08ac84a3c4636a7473de39f346a73d2a08999751ab3cf01bbab79f100626f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6d3a281d-699d-4260-8fd2-0de42be2044c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "7cfa2ee1e691ae1f2a090d4ffb7364a517dd6ca437d9b599116fe461b70bddbd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3d69ee09-5c7c-4c1f-80bf-dd19420872a8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7965948ab15b7af6680a3e267dc3adb5f1ac1da5e3848f4ad8959a5eac422577", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Accordingly he placed the prologue even before\nthe exposition, and put it in the mouth of a person who could be trusted: some\ndeity had often as it were to guarantee the particulars of the tragedy to the\npublic and remove every doubt as to the reality of the myth: as in the case of\nDescartes, who could only prove the reality of the empiric world by an appeal\nto the truthfulness of God and His inability to utter falsehood.

With reference to his critico-productive activity, he\nmust often have felt that he ought to actualise in the drama the words at the\nbeginning of the essay of Anaxagoras: \"In the beginning all things were mixed\ntogether; then came the understanding and created order.\" And if Anaxagoras\nwith his \"\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe1\u03c2\" seemed like the first sober person among nothing but drunken\nphilosophers, Euripides may also have conceived his relation to the other\ntragic poets under a similar figure. As long as the sole ruler and disposer of\nthe universe, the \u03bd\u03bf\u1fe1\u03c2, was still excluded from artistic activity, things were\nall mixed together in a chaotic, primitive mess;\u2014it is thus Euripides was\nobliged to think, it is thus he was obliged to condemn the \"drunken\" poets as\nthe first \"sober\" one among them. What Sophocles said of \u00c6schylus, that he did\nwhat was right, though unconsciously, was surely not in the mind of Euripides:\nwho would have admitted only thus much, that \u00c6schylus, _because_ he wrought\nunconsciously, did what was wrong. So also the divine Plato speaks for the\nmost part only ironically of the creative faculty of the poet, in so far as it\nis not conscious insight, and places it on a par with the gift of the\nsoothsayer and dream-interpreter; insinuating that the poet is incapable of\ncomposing until he has become unconscious and reason has deserted him. Like\nPlato, Euripides undertook to show to the world the reverse of the\n\"unintelligent\" poet; his \u00e6sthetic principle that \"to be beautiful everything\nmust be known\" is, as I have said, the parallel to the Socratic \"to be good\neverything must be known.\" Accordingly we may regard Euripides as the poet of\n\u00e6sthetic Socratism. Socrates, however, was that _second spectator_ who did not\ncomprehend and therefore did not esteem the Old Tragedy; in alliance with him\nEuripides ventured to be the herald of a new artistic activity. If, then, the\nOld Tragedy was here destroyed, it follows that \u00e6sthetic Socratism was the\nmurderous principle; but in so far as the struggle is directed against the\nDionysian element in the old art, we recognise in Socrates the opponent of\nDionysus, the new Orpheus who rebels against Dionysus; and although destined\nto be torn to pieces by the M\u00e6nads of the Athenian court, yet puts to flight\nthe overpowerful god himself, who, when he fled from Lycurgus, the king of\nEdoni, sought refuge in the depths of the ocean\u2014namely, in the mystical flood\nof a secret cult which gradually overspread the earth.\n\n#### 13.\n\nThat Socrates stood in close relationship to Euripides in the tendency of his\nteaching, did not escape the notice of contemporaneous antiquity; the most\neloquent expression of this felicitous insight being the tale current in\nAthens, that Socrates was accustomed to help Euripides in poetising.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 183899, "end_char_idx": 187603, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d69ee09-5c7c-4c1f-80bf-dd19420872a8": {"__data__": {"id_": "3d69ee09-5c7c-4c1f-80bf-dd19420872a8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11e7bbb4-f380-4d2a-b724-0bdf86b1b378", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "aeb08ac84a3c4636a7473de39f346a73d2a08999751ab3cf01bbab79f100626f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1415e883-52d7-4c0b-a0df-c602d07cf6ff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "608166c45e16ef4cea37ce0efde41c3a1ad961c664476d1f8adde5e5322bef24", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0d9b8ad5-34f5-45de-8ffa-e679ec703a2a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "caa9032b52a729037253c9392b0415afa808cc5e36ff0db345ad7bc2ca56e016", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "#### 13.\n\nThat Socrates stood in close relationship to Euripides in the tendency of his\nteaching, did not escape the notice of contemporaneous antiquity; the most\neloquent expression of this felicitous insight being the tale current in\nAthens, that Socrates was accustomed to help Euripides in poetising. Both\nnames were mentioned in one breath by the adherents of the \"good old time,\"\nwhenever they came to enumerating the popular agitators of the day: to whose\ninfluence they attributed the fact that the old Marathonian stalwart capacity\nof body and soul was more and more being sacrificed to a dubious\nenlightenment, involving progressive degeneration of the physical and mental\npowers. It is in this tone, half indignantly and half contemptuously, that\nAristophanic comedy is wont to speak of both of them\u2014to the consternation of\nmodern men, who would indeed be willing enough to give up Euripides, but\ncannot suppress their amazement that Socrates should appear in Aristophanes as\nthe first and head _sophist,_ as the mirror and epitome of all sophistical\ntendencies; in connection with which it offers the single consolation of\nputting Aristophanes himself in the pillory, as a rakish, lying Alcibiades of\npoetry. Without here defending the profound instincts of Aristophanes against\nsuch attacks, I shall now indicate, by means of the sentiments of the time,\nthe close connection between Socrates and Euripides. With this purpose in\nview, it is especially to be remembered that Socrates, as an opponent of\ntragic art, did not ordinarily patronise tragedy, but only appeared among the\nspectators when a new play of Euripides was performed. The most noted thing,\nhowever, is the close juxtaposition of the two names in the Delphic oracle,\nwhich designated Socrates as the wisest of men, but at the same time decided\nthat the second prize in the contest of wisdom was due to Euripides.\n\nSophocles was designated as the third in this scale of rank; he who could\npride himself that, in comparison with \u00c6schylus, he did what was right, and\ndid it, moreover, because he _knew_ what was right. It is evidently just the\ndegree of clearness of this _knowledge,_ which distinguishes these three men\nin common as the three \"knowing ones\" of their age.\n\nThe most decisive word, however, for this new and unprecedented esteem of\nknowledge and insight was spoken by Socrates when he found that he was the\nonly one who acknowledged to himself that he _knew nothing_ while in his\ncritical pilgrimage through Athens, and calling on the greatest statesmen,\norators, poets, and artists, he discovered everywhere the conceit of\nknowledge. He perceived, to his astonishment, that all these celebrities were\nwithout a proper and accurate insight, even with regard to their own callings,\nand practised them only by instinct. \"Only by instinct\": with this phrase we\ntouch upon the heart and core of the Socratic tendency. Socratism condemns\ntherewith existing art as well as existing ethics; wherever Socratism turns\nits searching eyes it beholds the lack of insight and the power of illusion;\nand from this lack infers the inner perversity and objectionableness of\nexisting conditions. From this point onwards, Socrates believed that he was\ncalled upon to, correct existence; and, with an air of disregard and\nsuperiority, as the precursor of an altogether different culture, art, and\nmorality, he enters single-handed into a world, of which, if we reverently\ntouched the hem, we should count it our greatest happiness.\n\nHere is the extraordinary hesitancy which always seizes upon us with regard to\nSocrates, and again and again invites us to ascertain the sense and purpose of\nthis most questionable phenomenon of antiquity.

In special\ncircumstances, when his gigantic intellect began to stagger, he got a secure\nsupport in the utterances of a divine voice which then spake to him. This\nvoice, whenever it comes, always _dissuades._ In this totally abnormal nature\ninstinctive wisdom only appears in order to hinder the progress of conscious\nperception here and there. While in all productive men it is instinct which is\nthe creatively affirmative force, consciousness only comporting itself\ncritically and dissuasively; with Socrates it is instinct which becomes\ncritic; it is consciousness which becomes creator\u2014a perfect monstrosity _per\ndefectum!_ And we do indeed observe here a monstrous _defectus_ of all\nmystical aptitude, so that Socrates might be designated as the specific _non-\nmystic,_ in whom the logical nature is developed, through a superfoetation, to\nthe same excess as instinctive wisdom is developed in the mystic. On the other\nhand, however, the logical instinct which appeared in Socrates was absolutely\nprohibited from turning against itself; in its unchecked flow it manifests a\nnative power such as we meet with, to our shocking surprise, only among the\nvery greatest instinctive forces. He who has experienced even a breath of the\ndivine na\u00efvet\u00e9 and security of the Socratic course of life in the Platonic\nwritings, will also feel that the enormous driving-wheel of logical Socratism\nis in motion, as it were, _behind_ Socrates, and that it must be viewed\nthrough Socrates as through a shadow. And that he himself had a boding of this\nrelation is apparent from the dignified earnestness with which he everywhere,\nand even before his judges, insisted on his divine calling. To refute him here\nwas really as impossible as to approve of his instinct-disintegrating\ninfluence. In view of this indissoluble conflict, when he had at last been\nbrought before the forum of the Greek state, there was only one punishment\ndemanded, namely exile; he might have been sped across the borders as\nsomething thoroughly enigmatical, irrubricable and inexplicable, and so\nposterity would have been quite unjustified in charging the Athenians with a\ndeed of ignominy. But that the sentence of death, and not mere exile, was\npronounced upon him, seems to have been brought about by Socrates himself,\nwith perfect knowledge of the circumstances, and without the natural fear of\ndeath: he met his death with the calmness with which, according to the\ndescription of Plato, he leaves the symposium at break of day, as the last of\nthe revellers, to begin a new day; while the sleepy companions remain behind\non the benches and the floor, to dream of Socrates, the true eroticist. _The\ndying Socrates_ became the new ideal of the noble Greek youths,\u2014an ideal they\nhad never yet beheld,\u2014and above all, the typical Hellenic youth, Plato,\nprostrated himself before this scene with all the fervent devotion of his\nvisionary soul.\n\n[[17]](491753352961627459_51356-h-3.htm.html#FNanchor_17_19)\n\nWoe!

Something very absurd, with causes\nthat seemed to be without effects, and effects apparently without causes; the\nwhole, moreover, so motley and diversified that it could not but be repugnant\nto a thoughtful mind, a dangerous incentive, however, to sensitive and\nirritable souls. We know what was the sole kind of poetry which he\ncomprehended: the _\u00c6sopian fable_ : and he did this no doubt with that smiling\ncomplaisance with which the good honest Gellert sings the praise of poetry in\nthe fable of the bee and the hen:\u2014\n\n\"Du siehst an mir, wozu sie n\u00fctzt,  \nDem, der nicht viel Verstand besitzt,  \nDie Wahrheit durch ein Bild zu\nsagen.\"[[18]](491753352961627459_51356-h-4.htm.html#Footnote_18_20)  \n\nBut then it seemed to Socrates that tragic art did not even \"tell the truth\":\nnot to mention the fact that it addresses itself to him who \"hath but little\nwit\"; consequently not to the philosopher: a twofold reason why it should be\navoided. Like Plato, he reckoned it among the seductive arts which only\nrepresent the agreeable, not the useful, and hence he required of his\ndisciples abstinence and strict separation from such unphilosophical\nallurements; with such success that the youthful tragic poet Plato first of\nall burned his poems to be able to become a scholar of Socrates. But where\nunconquerable native capacities bore up against the Socratic maxims, their\npower, together with the momentum of his mighty character, still sufficed to\nforce poetry itself into new and hitherto unknown channels.\n\nAn instance of this is the aforesaid Plato: he, who in the condemnation of\ntragedy and of art in general certainly did not fall short of the na\u00efve\ncynicism of his master, was nevertheless constrained by sheer artistic\nnecessity to create a form of art which is inwardly related even to the then\nexisting forms of art which he repudiated. Plato's main objection to the old\nart\u2014that it is the imitation of a\nphantom,[[19]](491753352961627459_51356-h-4.htm.html#Footnote_19_21) and hence\nbelongs to a sphere still lower than the empiric world\u2014could not at all apply\nto the new art: and so we find Plato endeavouring to go beyond reality and\nattempting to represent the idea which underlies this pseudo-reality. But\nPlato, the thinker, thereby arrived by a roundabout road just at the point\nwhere he had always been at home as poet, and from which Sophocles and all the\nold artists had solemnly protested against that objection. If tragedy absorbed\ninto itself all the earlier varieties of art, the same could again be said in\nan unusual sense of Platonic dialogue, which, engendered by a mixture of all\nthe then existing forms and styles, hovers midway between narrative, lyric and\ndrama, between prose and poetry, and has also thereby broken loose from the\nolder strict law of unity of linguistic form; a movement which was carried\nstill farther by the _cynic_ writers, who in the most promiscuous style,\noscillating to and fro betwixt prose and metrical forms, realised also the\nliterary picture of the \"raving Socrates\" whom they were wont to represent in\nlife.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 194367, "end_char_idx": 198238, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6369165f-c418-4aea-b5e9-35caa093278d": {"__data__": {"id_": "6369165f-c418-4aea-b5e9-35caa093278d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11e7bbb4-f380-4d2a-b724-0bdf86b1b378", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "aeb08ac84a3c4636a7473de39f346a73d2a08999751ab3cf01bbab79f100626f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fcffee11-771d-4258-a96f-39537129161a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "8443a993e3d29af220dc9fe604d086c0d179ef5de6a7c7480be5272926988d9d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3a516769-aa3e-4325-9c6c-37e9c90e742c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f4a8332f3a1a56ef9f5f0cac55038ac93b5125c312f0bf71330cd42c687d2060", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "If tragedy absorbed\ninto itself all the earlier varieties of art, the same could again be said in\nan unusual sense of Platonic dialogue, which, engendered by a mixture of all\nthe then existing forms and styles, hovers midway between narrative, lyric and\ndrama, between prose and poetry, and has also thereby broken loose from the\nolder strict law of unity of linguistic form; a movement which was carried\nstill farther by the _cynic_ writers, who in the most promiscuous style,\noscillating to and fro betwixt prose and metrical forms, realised also the\nliterary picture of the \"raving Socrates\" whom they were wont to represent in\nlife. Platonic dialogue was as it were the boat in which the shipwrecked\nancient poetry saved herself together with all her children: crowded into a\nnarrow space and timidly obsequious to the one steersman, Socrates, they now\nlaunched into a new world, which never tired of looking at the fantastic\nspectacle of this procession. In very truth, Plato has given to all posterity\nthe prototype of a new form of art, the prototype of the _novel_ which must be\ndesignated as the infinitely evolved \u00c6sopian fable, in which poetry holds the\nsame rank with reference to dialectic philosophy as this same philosophy held\nfor many centuries with reference to theology: namely, the rank of _ancilla._\nThis was the new position of poetry into which Plato forced it under the\npressure of the demon-inspired Socrates.\n\nHere _philosophic thought_ overgrows art and compels it to cling close to the\ntrunk of dialectics. The _Apollonian_ tendency has chrysalised in the logical\nschematism; just as something analogous in the case of Euripides (and moreover\na translation of the _Dionysian_ into the naturalistic emotion) was forced\nupon our attention. Socrates, the dialectical hero in Platonic drama, reminds\nus of the kindred nature of the Euripidean hero, who has to defend his actions\nby arguments and counter-arguments, and thereby so often runs the risk of\nforfeiting our tragic pity; for who could mistake the _optimistic_ element in\nthe essence of dialectics, which celebrates a jubilee in every conclusion, and\ncan breathe only in cool clearness and consciousness: the optimistic element,\nwhich, having once forced its way into tragedy, must gradually overgrow its\nDionysian regions, and necessarily impel it to self-destruction\u2014even to the\ndeath-leap into the bourgeois drama. Let us but realise the consequences of\nthe Socratic maxims: \"Virtue is knowledge; man only sins from ignorance; he\nwho is virtuous is happy\": these three fundamental forms of optimism involve\nthe death of tragedy. For the virtuous hero must now be a dialectician; there\nmust now be a necessary, visible connection between virtue and knowledge,\nbetween belief and morality; the transcendental justice of the plot in\n\u00c6schylus is now degraded to the superficial and audacious principle of poetic\njustice with its usual _deus ex machina_.\n\nHow does the _chorus,_ and, in general, the entire Dionyso-musical substratum\nof tragedy, now appear in the light of this new Socrato-optimistic stage-\nworld? As something accidental, as a readily dispensable reminiscence of the\norigin of tragedy; while we have in fact seen that the chorus can be\nunderstood only as the cause of tragedy, and of the tragic generally. This\nperplexity with respect to the chorus first manifests itself in Sophocles\u2014an\nimportant sign that the Dionysian basis of tragedy already begins to\ndisintegrate with him. He no longer ventures to entrust to the chorus the main\nshare of the effect, but limits its sphere to such an extent that it now\nappears almost co-ordinate with the actors, just as if it were elevated from\nthe orchestra into the scene: whereby of course its character is completely\ndestroyed, notwithstanding that Aristotle countenances this very theory of the\nchorus.

Optimistic dialectics drives, _music_ out of\ntragedy with the scourge of its syllogisms: that is, it destroys the essence\nof tragedy, which can be explained only as a manifestation and illustration of\nDionysian states, as the visible symbolisation of music, as the dream-world of\nDionysian ecstasy.\n\nIf, therefore, we are to assume an anti-Dionysian tendency operating even\nbefore Socrates, which received in him only an unprecedentedly grand\nexpression, we must not shrink from the question as to what a phenomenon like\nthat of Socrates indicates: whom in view of the Platonic dialogues we are\ncertainly not entitled to regard as a purely disintegrating, negative power.\nAnd though there can be no doubt whatever that the most immediate effect of\nthe Socratic impulse tended to the dissolution of Dionysian tragedy, yet a\nprofound experience of Socrates' own life compels us to ask whether there is\n_necessarily_ only an antipodal relation between Socratism and art, and\nwhether the birth of an \"artistic Socrates\" is in general something\ncontradictory in itself.\n\nFor that despotic logician had now and then the feeling of a gap, or void, a\nsentiment of semi-reproach, as of a possibly neglected duty with respect to\nart. There often came to him, as he tells his friends in prison, one and the\nsame dream-apparition, which kept constantly repeating to him: \"Socrates,\npractise music.\" Up to his very last days he solaces himself with the opinion\nthat his philosophising is the highest form of poetry, and finds it hard to\nbelieve that a deity will remind him of the \"common, popular music.\" Finally,\nwhen in prison, he consents to practise also this despised music, in order\nthoroughly to unburden his conscience. And in this frame of mind he composes a\npoem on Apollo and turns a few \u00c6sopian fables into verse. It was something\nsimilar to the demonian warning voice which urged him to these practices; it\nwas because of his Apollonian insight that, like a barbaric king, he did not\nunderstand the noble image of a god and was in danger of sinning against a\ndeity\u2014through ignorance.

Nearly every age and stage\nof culture has at some time or other sought with deep displeasure to free\nitself from the Greeks, because in their presence everything self-achieved,\nsincerely admired and apparently quite original, seemed all of a sudden to\nlose life and colour and shrink to an abortive copy, even to caricature. And\nso hearty indignation breaks forth time after time against this presumptuous\nlittle nation, which dared to designate as \"barbaric\" for all time everything\nnot native: who are they, one asks one's self, who, though they possessed only\nan ephemeral historical splendour, ridiculously restricted institutions, a\ndubious excellence in their customs, and were even branded with ugly vices,\nyet lay claim to the dignity and singular position among the peoples to which\ngenius is entitled among the masses. What a pity one has not been so fortunate\nas to find the cup of hemlock with which such an affair could be disposed of\nwithout ado: for all the poison which envy, calumny, and rankling resentment\nengendered within themselves have not sufficed to destroy that self-sufficient\ngrandeur! And so one feels ashamed and afraid in the presence of the Greeks:\nunless one prize truth above all things, and dare also to acknowledge to one's\nself this truth, that the Greeks, as charioteers, hold in their hands the\nreins of our own and of every culture, but that almost always chariot and\nhorses are of too poor material and incommensurate with the glory of their\nguides, who then will deem it sport to run such a team into an abyss: which\nthey themselves clear with the leap of Achilles.\n\nIn order to assign also to Socrates the dignity of such a leading position, it\nwill suffice to recognise in him the type of an unheard-of form of existence,\nthe type of the _theoretical man,_ with regard to whose meaning and purpose it\nwill be our next task to attain an insight. Like the artist, the theorist also\nfinds an infinite satisfaction in what _is_ and, like the former, he is\nshielded by this satisfaction from the practical ethics of pessimism with its\nlynx eyes which shine only in the dark. For if the artist in every unveiling\nof truth always cleaves with raptured eyes only to that which still remains\nveiled after the unveiling, the theoretical man, on the other hand, enjoys and\ncontents himself with the cast-off veil, and finds the consummation of his\npleasure in the process of a continuously successful unveiling through his own\nunaided efforts. There would have been no science if it had only been\nconcerned about that _one_ naked goddess and nothing else. For then its\ndisciples would have been obliged to feel like those who purposed to dig a\nhole straight through the earth: each one of whom perceives that with the\nutmost lifelong exertion he is able to excavate only a very little of the\nenormous depth, which is again filled up before his eyes by the labours of his\nsuccessor, so that a third man seems to do well when on his own account he\nselects a new spot for his attempts at tunnelling.

For that reason Lessing, the most honest theoretical man,\nventured to say that he cared more for the search after truth than for truth\nitself: in saying which he revealed the fundamental secret of science, to the\nastonishment, and indeed, to the vexation of scientific men. Well, to be sure,\nthere stands alongside of this detached perception, as an excess of honesty,\nif not of presumption, a profound _illusion_ which first came to the world in\nthe person of Socrates, the imperturbable belief that, by means of the clue of\ncausality, thinking reaches to the deepest abysses of being, and that thinking\nis able not only to perceive being but even to _correct_ it. This sublime\nmetaphysical illusion is added as an instinct to science and again and again\nleads the latter to its limits, where it must change into _art; which is\nreally the end, to be attained by this mechanism_.\n\nIf we now look at Socrates in the light of this thought, he appears to us as\nthe first who could not only live, but\u2014what is far more\u2014also die under the\nguidance of this instinct of science: and hence the picture of the _dying,\nSocrates_ , as the man delivered from the fear of death by knowledge and\nargument, is the escutcheon, above the entrance to science which reminds every\none of its mission, namely, to make existence appear to be comprehensible, and\ntherefore to be justified: for which purpose, if arguments do not suffice,\n_myth_ also must be used, which I just now designated even as the necessary\nconsequence, yea, as the end of science.\n\nHe who once makes intelligible to himself how, after the death of Socrates,\nthe mystagogue of science, one philosophical school succeeds another, like\nwave upon wave,\u2014how an entirely unfore-shadowed universal development of the\nthirst for knowledge in the widest compass of the cultured world (and as the\nspecific task for every one highly gifted) led science on to the high sea from\nwhich since then it has never again been able to be completely ousted; how\nthrough the universality of this movement a common net of thought was first\nstretched over the entire globe, with prospects, moreover, of conformity to\nlaw in an entire solar system;\u2014he who realises all this, together with the\namazingly high pyramid of our present-day knowledge, cannot fail to see in\nSocrates the turning-point and vortex of so-called universal history. For if\none were to imagine the whole incalculable sum of energy which has been used\nup by that universal tendency,\u2014employed, _not_ in the service of knowledge,\nbut for the practical, _i.e.,_ egoistical ends of individuals and\npeoples,\u2014then probably the instinctive love of life would be so much weakened\nin universal wars of destruction and incessant migrations of peoples, that,\nowing to the practice of suicide, the individual would perhaps feel the last\nremnant of a sense of duty, when, like the native of the Fiji Islands, as son\nhe strangles his parents and, as friend, his friend: a practical pessimism\nwhich might even give rise to a horrible ethics of general slaughter out of\npity\u2014which, for the rest, exists and has existed wherever art in one form or\nanother, especially as science and religion, has not appeared as a remedy and\npreventive of that pestilential breath.\n\nIn view of this practical pessimism, Socrates is the archetype of the\ntheoretical optimist, who in the above-indicated belief in the fathomableness\nof the nature of things, attributes to knowledge and perception the power of a\nuniversal medicine, and sees in error and evil.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 207677, "end_char_idx": 212013, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02ab9a80-66f3-4b09-86da-3a1f21cf9840": {"__data__": {"id_": "02ab9a80-66f3-4b09-86da-3a1f21cf9840", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11e7bbb4-f380-4d2a-b724-0bdf86b1b378", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "aeb08ac84a3c4636a7473de39f346a73d2a08999751ab3cf01bbab79f100626f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0658da70-6903-479b-8826-25fc8fc3148c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "7bb8ad2f3eda25124c9faff64535098cd80dc0601e4f73f088e6c4210976e6b6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6afa3f78-3685-46dc-9ece-33e8adc32664", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8d0d99f0742efd49011fea05db7912277608ac01a885d54c90cd9b4c2a2ea0c1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In view of this practical pessimism, Socrates is the archetype of the\ntheoretical optimist, who in the above-indicated belief in the fathomableness\nof the nature of things, attributes to knowledge and perception the power of a\nuniversal medicine, and sees in error and evil. To penetrate into the depths\nof the nature of things, and to separate true perception from error and\nillusion, appeared to the Socratic man the noblest and even the only truly\nhuman calling: just as from the time of Socrates onwards the mechanism of\nconcepts, judgments, and inferences was prized above all other capacities as\nthe highest activity and the most admirable gift of nature. Even the sublimest\nmoral acts, the stirrings of pity, of self-sacrifice, of heroism, and that\ntranquillity of soul, so difficult of attainment, which the Apollonian Greek\ncalled Sophrosyne, were derived by Socrates, and his like-minded successors up\nto the present day, from the dialectics of knowledge, and were accordingly\ndesignated as teachable. He who has experienced in himself the joy of a\nSocratic perception, and felt how it seeks to embrace, in constantly widening\ncircles, the entire world of phenomena, will thenceforth find no stimulus\nwhich could urge him to existence more forcible than the desire to complete\nthat conquest and to knit the net impenetrably close. To a person thus minded\nthe Platonic Socrates then appears as the teacher of an entirely new form of\n\"Greek cheerfulness\" and felicity of existence, which seeks to discharge\nitself in actions, and will find its discharge for the most part in maieutic\nand pedagogic influences on noble youths, with a view to the ultimate\nproduction of genius.\n\nBut now science, spurred on by its powerful illusion, hastens irresistibly to\nits limits, on which its optimism, hidden in the essence of logic, is wrecked.\nFor the periphery of the circle of science has an infinite number of points,\nand while there is still no telling how this circle can ever be completely\nmeasured, yet the noble and gifted man, even before the middle of his career,\ninevitably comes into contact with those extreme points of the periphery where\nhe stares at the inexplicable. When he here sees to his dismay how logic coils\nround itself at these limits and finally bites its own tail\u2014then the new form\nof perception discloses itself, namely _tragic perception,_ which, in order\neven to be endured, requires art as a safeguard and remedy.\n\nIf, with eyes strengthened and refreshed at the sight of the Greeks, we look\nupon the highest spheres of the world that surrounds us, we behold the avidity\nof the insatiate optimistic knowledge, of which Socrates is the typical\nrepresentative, transformed into tragic resignation and the need of art:\nwhile, to be sure, this same avidity, in its lower stages, has to exhibit\nitself as antagonistic to art, and must especially have an inward detestation\nof Dionyso-tragic art, as was exemplified in the opposition of Socratism to\n\u00c6schylean tragedy.\n\nHere then with agitated spirit we knock at the gates of the present and the\nfuture: will that \"transforming\" lead to ever new configurations of genius,\nand especially of the _music-practising Socrates_? Will the net of art which\nis spread over existence, whether under the name of religion or of science, be\nknit always more closely and delicately, or is it destined to be torn to\nshreds under the restlessly barbaric activity and whirl which is called \"the\npresent day\"?\u2014Anxious, yet not disconsolate, we stand aloof for a little\nwhile, as the spectators who are permitted to be witnesses of these tremendous\nstruggles and transitions.

I will speak only of the _Most Illustrious Opposition_ to the\ntragic conception of things\u2014and by this I mean essentially optimistic science,\nwith its ancestor Socrates at the head of it.

In contrast to all those who\nare intent on deriving the arts from one exclusive principle, as the necessary\nvital source of every work of art, I keep my eyes fixed on the two artistic\ndeities of the Greeks, Apollo and Dionysus, and recognise in them the living\nand conspicuous representatives of _two_ worlds of art which differ in their\nintrinsic essence and in their highest aims. Apollo stands before me as the\ntransfiguring genius of the _principium individuationis_ through which alone\nthe redemption in appearance is to be truly attained, while by the mystical\ncheer of Dionysus the spell of individuation is broken, and the way lies open\nto the Mothers of Being,[20] to the innermost heart of things. This\nextraordinary antithesis, which opens up yawningly between plastic art as the\nApollonian and music as the Dionysian art, has become manifest to only one of\nthe great thinkers, to such an extent that, even without this key to the\nsymbolism of the Hellenic divinities, he allowed to music a different\ncharacter and origin in advance of all the other arts, because, unlike them,\nit is not a copy of the phenomenon, but a direct copy of the will itself, and\ntherefore represents _the metaphysical of everything physical in the world_,\nthe thing-in-itself of every phenomenon. (Schopenhauer, _Welt als Wille und\nVorstellung,_ I. 310.) To this most important perception of \u00e6sthetics (with\nwhich, taken in a serious sense, \u00e6sthetics properly commences), Richard\nWagner, by way of confirmation of its eternal truth, affixed his seal, when he\nasserted in his _Beethoven_ that music must be judged according to \u00e6sthetic\nprinciples quite different from those which apply to the plastic arts, and\nnot, in general, according to the category of beauty: although an erroneous\n\u00e6sthetics, inspired by a misled and degenerate art, has by virtue of the\nconcept of beauty prevailing in the plastic domain accustomed itself to demand\nof music an effect analogous to that of the works of plastic art, namely the\nsuscitating _delight in beautiful forms._ Upon perceiving this extraordinary\nantithesis, I felt a strong inducement to approach the essence of Greek\ntragedy, and, by means of it, the profoundest revelation of Hellenic genius:\nfor I at last thought myself to be in possession of a charm to enable me\u2014far\nbeyond the phraseology of our usual \u00e6sthetics\u2014to represent vividly to my mind\nthe primitive problem of tragedy: whereby such an astounding insight into the\nHellenic character was afforded me that it necessarily seemed as if our\nproudly comporting classico-Hellenic science had thus far contrived to subsist\nalmost exclusively on phantasmagoria and externalities.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 215370, "end_char_idx": 219604, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c2bf7910-22cd-402f-b67f-7ad5568e98c8": {"__data__": {"id_": "c2bf7910-22cd-402f-b67f-7ad5568e98c8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11e7bbb4-f380-4d2a-b724-0bdf86b1b378", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "aeb08ac84a3c4636a7473de39f346a73d2a08999751ab3cf01bbab79f100626f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6afa3f78-3685-46dc-9ece-33e8adc32664", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "dd1b5a7306541183913f077b3da207d44319d6c5e7db7e22c8f8e0bb83eb9d7c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "505a6866-6f48-40f0-9434-1b615b6046b5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "13ee7966cc9c4685962b509455c638bcb2ac98ccc738a548db17532f077411a3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Perhaps we may lead up to this primitive problem with the question: what\n\u00e6sthetic effect results when the intrinsically separate art-powers, the\nApollonian and the Dionysian, enter into concurrent actions? Or, in briefer\nform: how is music related to image and concept?\u2014Schopenhauer, whom Richard\nWagner, with especial reference to this point, accredits with an unsurpassable\nclearness and perspicuity of exposition, expresses himself most copiously on\nthe subject in the following passage which I shall cite here at full\nlength[[21]](491753352961627459_51356-h-4.htm.html#Footnote_21_23) (_Welt als\nWille und Vorstellung,_ I. p. 309): \"According to all this, we may regard the\nphenomenal world, or nature, and music as two different expressions of the\nsame thing,[[20]](491753352961627459_51356-h-4.htm.html#Footnote_20_22) which\nis therefore itself the only medium of the analogy between these two\nexpressions, so that a knowledge of this medium is required in order to\nunderstand that analogy. Music, therefore, if regarded as an expression of the\nworld, is in the highest degree a universal language, which is related indeed\nto the universality of concepts, much as these are related to the particular\nthings. Its universality, however, is by no means the empty universality of\nabstraction, but of quite a different kind, and is united with thorough and\ndistinct definiteness. In this respect it resembles geometrical figures and\nnumbers, which are the universal forms of all possible objiects of experience\nand applicable to them all _a priori_ , and yet are not abstract but\nperceptiple and thoroughly determinate. All possible efforts, excitements and\nmanifestations of will, all that goes on in the heart of man and that reason\nincludes in the wide, negative concept of feeling, may be expressed by the\ninfinite number of possible melodies, but always in the universality of mere\nform, without the material, always according to the thing-in-itself, not the\nphenomenon,\u2014of which they reproduce the very soul and essence as it were,\nwithout the body. This deep relation which music bears to the true nature of\nall things also explains the fact that suitable music played to any scene,\naction, event, or surrounding seems to disclose to us its most secret meaning,\nand appears as the most accurate and distinct commentary upon it; as also the\nfact that whoever gives himself up entirely to the impression of a symphony\nseems to see all the possible events of life and the world take place in\nhimself: nevertheless upon reflection he can find no likeness between the\nmusic and the things that passed before his mind. For, as we have said, music\nis distinguished from all the other arts by the fact that it is not a copy of\nthe phenomenon, or, more accurately, the adequate objectivity of the will, but\nthe direct copy of the will itself, and therefore represents the metaphysical\nof everything physical in the world, and the thing-in-itself of every\nphenomenon. We might, therefore, just as well call the world embodied music as\nembodied will: and this is the reason why music makes every picture, and\nindeed every scene of real life and of the world, at once appear with higher\nsignificance; all the more so, to be sure, in proportion as its melody is\nanalogous to the inner spirit of the given phenomenon. It rests upon this that\nwe are able to set a poem to music as a song, or a perceptible representation\nas a pantomime, or both as an opera. Such particular pictures of human life,\nset to the universal language of music, are never bound to it or correspond to\nit with stringent necessity, but stand to it only in the relation of an\nexample chosen at will to a general concept. In the determinateness of the\nreal they represent that which music expresses in the universality of mere\nform.

This actual world, then, the world of particular\nthings, affords the object of perception, the special and the individual, the\nparticular case, both to the universality of concepts and to the universality\nof the melodies. But these two universalities are in a certain respect opposed\nto each other; for the concepts contain only the forms, which are first of all\nabstracted from perception,\u2014the separated outward shell of things, as it\nwere,\u2014and hence they are, in the strictest sense of the term, _abstracta_ ;\nmusic, on the other hand, gives the inmost kernel which precedes all forms, or\nthe heart of things. This relation may be very well expressed in the language\nof the schoolmen, by saying: the concepts are the _universalia post rem,_ but\nmusic gives the _universalia ante rem,_ and the real world the _universalia in\nre._ \u2014But that in general a relation is possible between a composition and a\nperceptible representation rests, as we have said, upon the fact that both are\nsimply different expressions of the same inner being of the world. When now,\nin the particular case, such a relation is actually given, that is to say,\nwhen the composer has been able to express in the universal language of music\nthe emotions of will which constitute the heart of an event, then the melody\nof the song, the music of the opera, is expressive. But the analogy discovered\nby the composer between the two must have proceeded from the direct knowledge\nof the nature of the world unknown to his reason, and must not be an imitation\nproduced with conscious intention by means of conceptions; otherwise the music\ndoes not express the inner nature of the will itself, but merely gives an\ninadequate imitation of its phenomenon: all specially imitative music does\nthis.\"\n\nWe have therefore, according to the doctrine of Schopenhauer, an immediate\nunderstanding of music as the language of the will, and feel our imagination\nstimulated to give form to this invisible and yet so actively stirred spirit-\nworld which speaks to us, and prompted to embody it in an analogous example.\nOn the other hand, image and concept, under the influence of a truly\nconformable music, acquire a higher significance. Dionysian art therefore is\nwont to exercise\u2014two kinds of influences, on the Apollonian art-faculty: music\nfirstly incites to the _symbolic intuition_ of Dionysian universality, and,\nsecondly, it causes the symbolic image to stand forth _in its fullest\nsignificance._ From these facts, intelligible in themselves and not\ninaccessible to profounder observation, I infer the capacity of music to give\nbirth to _myth,_ that is to say, the most significant exemplar, and precisely\n_tragic_ myth: the myth which speaks of Dionysian knowledge in symbols. In the\nphenomenon of the lyrist, I have set forth that in him music strives to\nexpress itself with regard to its nature in Apollonian images. If now we\nreflect that music in its highest potency must seek to attain also to its\nhighest symbolisation, we must deem it possible that it also knows how to find\nthe symbolic expression of its inherent Dionysian wisdom; and where shall we\nhave to seek for this expression if not in tragedy and, in general, in the\nconception of the _tragic_?\n\nFrom the nature of art, as it is ordinarily conceived according to the single\ncategory of appearance and beauty, the tragic cannot be honestly deduced at\nall; it is only through the spirit of music that we understand the joy in the\nannihilation of the individual.

The Greeks are, as the Egyptian priests say, eternal\nchildren, and in tragic art also they are only children who do not know what a\nsublime play-thing has originated under their hands and\u2014is being demolished.\n\nThat striving of the spirit of music for symbolic and mythical manifestation,\nwhich increases from the beginnings of lyric poetry to Attic tragedy, breaks\noff all of a sudden immediately after attaining luxuriant development, and\ndisappears, as it were, from the surface of Hellenic art: while the Dionysian\nview of things born of this striving lives on in Mysteries and, in its\nstrangest metamorphoses and debasements, does not cease to attract earnest\nnatures. Will it not one day rise again as art out of its mystic depth?\n\nHere the question occupies us, whether the power by the counteracting\ninfluence of which tragedy perished, has for all time strength enough to\nprevent the artistic reawaking of tragedy and of the tragic view of things. If\nancient tragedy was driven from its course by the dialectical desire for\nknowledge and the optimism of science, it might be inferred that there is an\neternal conflict between _the theoretic_ and _the tragic view of things,_ and\nonly after the spirit of science has been led to its boundaries, and its claim\nto universal validity has been destroyed by the evidence of these boundaries,\ncan we hope for a re-birth of tragedy: for which form of culture we should\nhave to use the symbol _of the music-practising Socrates_ in the sense spoken\nof above. In this contrast, I understand by the spirit of science the belief\nwhich first came to light in the person of Socrates,\u2014the belief in the\nfathomableness of nature and in knowledge as a panacea.\n\nHe who recalls the immediate consequences of this restlessly onward-pressing\nspirit of science will realise at once that _myth_ was annihilated by it, and\nthat, in consequence of this annihilation, poetry was driven as a homeless\nbeing from her natural ideal soil. If we have rightly assigned to music the\ncapacity to reproduce myth from itself, we may in turn expect to find the\nspirit of science on the path where it inimically opposes this mythopoeic\npower of music. This takes place in the development of the _New Attic\nDithyramb,_ the music of which no longer expressed the inner essence, the will\nitself, but only rendered the phenomenon insufficiently, in an imitation by\nmeans of concepts; from which intrinsically degenerate music the truly musical\nnatures turned away with the same repugnance that they felt for the art-\ndestroying tendency of Socrates.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 230051, "end_char_idx": 234500, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aa535d73-ef2b-47d3-a5c4-171af2370ac4": {"__data__": {"id_": "aa535d73-ef2b-47d3-a5c4-171af2370ac4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11e7bbb4-f380-4d2a-b724-0bdf86b1b378", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "aeb08ac84a3c4636a7473de39f346a73d2a08999751ab3cf01bbab79f100626f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1b8e47b0-6fec-4708-ab9c-ae48cacf4b08", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "7c3166801441cc9bc87a3353b3be43f7fdcf7daa1ddc96bdac357c1fa3b22ea3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ec145ae1-6371-4099-bde4-2107e453e6f0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d3cf9e6aaf9c59e77642f81cdac40baaeddb2939e6e9c357c784e62f6a6350f6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "He who recalls the immediate consequences of this restlessly onward-pressing\nspirit of science will realise at once that _myth_ was annihilated by it, and\nthat, in consequence of this annihilation, poetry was driven as a homeless\nbeing from her natural ideal soil.

The unerring instinct of Aristophanes surely\ndid the proper thing when it comprised Socrates himself, the tragedy of\nEuripides, and the music of the new Dithyrambic poets in the same feeling of\nhatred, and perceived in all three phenomena the symptoms of a degenerate\nculture. By this New Dithyramb, music has in an outrageous manner been made\nthe imitative portrait of phenomena, for instance, of a battle or a storm at\nsea, and has thus, of course, been entirely deprived of its mythopoeic power.\nFor if it endeavours to excite our delight only by compelling us to seek\nexternal analogies between a vital or natural process and certain rhythmical\nfigures and characteristic sounds of music; if our understanding is expected\nto satisfy itself with the perception of these analogies, we are reduced to a\nframe of mind in which the reception of the mythical is impossible; for the\nmyth as a unique exemplar of generality and truth towering into the infinite,\ndesires to be conspicuously perceived. The truly Dionysean music presents\nitself to us as such a general mirror of the universal will: the conspicuous\nevent which is refracted in this mirror expands at once for our consciousness\nto the copy of an eternal truth. Conversely, such a conspicious event is at\nonce divested of every mythical character by the tone-painting of the New\nDithyramb; music has here become a wretched copy of the phenomenon, and\ntherefore infinitely poorer than the phenomenon itself: through which poverty\nit still further reduces even the phenomenon for our consciousness, so that\nnow, for instance, a musically imitated battle of this sort exhausts itself in\nmarches, signal-sounds, etc., and our imagination is arrested precisely by\nthese superficialities. Tone-painting is therefore in every respect the\ncounterpart of true music with its mythopoeic power: through it the\nphenomenon, poor in itself, is made still poorer, while through an isolated\nDionysian music the phenomenon is evolved and expanded into a picture of the\nworld. It was an immense triumph of the non-Dionysian spirit, when, in the\ndevelopment of the New Dithyramb, it had estranged music from itself and\nreduced it to be the slave of phenomena. Euripides, who, albeit in a higher\nsense, must be designated as a thoroughly unmusical nature, is for this very\nreason a passionate adherent of the New Dithyrambic Music, and with the\nliberality of a freebooter employs all its effective turns and mannerisms.\n\nIn another direction also we see at work the power of this un-Dionysian, myth-\nopposing spirit, when we turn our eyes to the prevalence of _character\nrepresentation_ and psychological refinement from Sophocles onwards. The\ncharacter must no longer be expanded into an eternal type, but, on the\ncontrary, must operate individually through artistic by-traits and shadings,\nthrough the nicest precision of all lines, in such a manner that the spectator\nis in general no longer conscious of the myth, but of the mighty nature-myth\nand the imitative power of the artist.

The movement along the line of the representation of\ncharacter proceeds rapidly: while Sophocles still delineates complete\ncharacters and employs myth for their refined development, Euripides already\ndelineates only prominent individual traits of character, which can express\nthemselves in violent bursts of passion; in the New Attic Comedy, however,\nthere are only masks with _one_ expression: frivolous old men, duped panders,\nand cunning slaves in untiring repetition. Where now is the mythopoeic spirit\nof music? What is still left now of music is either excitatory music or\nsouvenir music, that is, either a stimulant for dull and used-up nerves, or\ntone-painting. As regards the former, it hardly matters about the text set to\nit: the heroes and choruses of Euripides are already dissolute enough when\nonce they begin to sing; to what pass must things have come with his brazen\nsuccessors?\n\nThe new un-Dionysian spirit, however, manifests itself most clearly in the\n_d\u00e9nouements_ of the new dramas. In the Old Tragedy one could feel at the\nclose the metaphysical comfort, without which the delight in tragedy cannot be\nexplained at all; the conciliating tones from another world sound purest,\nperhaps, in the \u0152dipus at Colonus. Now that the genius of music has fled from\ntragedy, tragedy is, strictly speaking, dead: for from whence could one now\ndraw the metaphysical comfort? One sought, therefore, for an earthly\nunravelment of the tragic dissonance; the hero, after he had been sufficiently\ntortured by fate, reaped a well-deserved reward through a superb marriage or\ndivine tokens of favour. The hero had turned gladiator, on whom, after being\nliberally battered about and covered with wounds, freedom was occasionally\nbestowed. The _deus ex machina_ took the place of metaphysical comfort. I will\nnot say that the tragic view of things was everywhere completely destroyed by\nthe intruding spirit of the un-Dionysian: we only know that it was compelled\nto flee from art into the under-world as it were, in the degenerate form of a\nsecret cult.

One is chained by the Socratic love of knowledge and the vain hope of\nbeing able thereby to heal the eternal wound of existence; another is ensnared\nby art's seductive veil of beauty fluttering before his eyes; still another by\nthe metaphysical comfort that eternal life flows on indestructibly beneath the\nwhirl of phenomena: to say nothing of the more ordinary and almost more\npowerful illusions which the will has always at hand. These three specimens of\nillusion are on the whole designed only for the more nobly endowed natures,\nwho in general feel profoundly the weight and burden of existence, and must be\ndeluded into forgetfulness of their displeasure by exquisite stimulants. All\nthat we call culture is made up of these stimulants; and, according to the\nproportion of the ingredients, we have either a specially _Socratic_ or\n_artistic_ or _tragic culture_ : or, if historical exemplifications are\nwanted, there is either an Alexandrine or a Hellenic or a Buddhistic culture.\n\nOur whole modern world is entangled in the meshes of Alexandrine culture, and\nrecognises as its ideal the _theorist_ equipped with the most potent means of\nknowledge, and labouring in the service of science, of whom the archetype and\nprogenitor is Socrates.

Well, we must not be\nalarmed if the fruits of this optimism ripen,\u2014if society, leavened to the very\nlowest strata by this kind of culture, gradually begins to tremble through\nwanton agitations and desires, if the belief in the earthly happiness of all,\nif the belief in the possibility of such a general intellectual culture is\ngradually transformed into the threatening demand for such an Alexandrine\nearthly happiness, into the conjuring of a Euripidean _deus ex machina._ Let\nus mark this well: the Alexandrine culture requires a slave class, to be able\nto exist permanently: but, in its optimistic view of life, it denies the\nnecessity of such a class, and consequently, when the effect of its\nbeautifully seductive and tranquillising utterances about the \"dignity of man\"\nand the \"dignity of labour\" is spent, it gradually drifts towards a dreadful\ndestination. There is nothing more terrible than a barbaric slave class, who\nhave learned to regard their existence as an injustice, and now prepare to\ntake vengeance, not only for themselves, but for all generations. In the face\nof such threatening storms, who dares to appeal with confident spirit to our\npale and exhausted religions, which even in their foundations have degenerated\ninto scholastic religions?\u2014so that myth, the necessary prerequisite of every\nreligion, is already paralysed everywhere, and even in this domain the\noptimistic spirit\u2014which we have just designated as the annihilating germ of\nsociety\u2014has attained the mastery.\n\nWhile the evil slumbering in the heart of theoretical culture gradually begins\nto disquiet modern man, and makes him anxiously ransack the stores of his\nexperience for means to avert the danger, though not believing very much in\nthese means; while he, therefore, begins to divine the consequences his\nposition involves: great, universally gifted natures have contrived, with an\nincredible amount of thought, to make use of the apparatus of science itself,\nin order to point out the limits and the relativity of knowledge generally,\nand thus definitely to deny the claim of science to universal validity and\nuniversal ends: with which demonstration the illusory notion was for the first\ntime recognised as such, which pretends, with the aid of causality, to be able\nto fathom the innermost essence of things.

Introduction,\np. 14.\n\n#### 19.\n\nWe cannot designate the intrinsic substance of Socratic culture more\ndistinctly than by calling it _the culture of the opera_ : for it is in this\ndepartment that culture has expressed itself with special na\u00efvet\u00e9 concerning\nits aims and perceptions, which is sufficiently surprising when we compare the\ngenesis of the opera and the facts of operatic development with the eternal\ntruths of the Apollonian and Dionysian. I call to mind first of all the origin\nof the _stilo rappresentativo_ and the recitative. Is it credible that this\nthoroughly externalised operatic music, incapable of devotion, could be\nreceived and cherished with enthusiastic favour, as a re-birth, as it were, of\nall true music, by the very age in which the ineffably sublime and sacred\nmusic of Palestrina had originated? And who, on the other hand, would think of\nmaking only the diversion-craving luxuriousness of those Florentine circles\nand the vanity of their dramatic singers responsible for the love of the opera\nwhich spread with such rapidity? That in the same age, even among the same\npeople, this passion for a half-musical mode of speech should awaken alongside\nof the vaulted structure of Palestrine harmonies which the entire Christian\nMiddle Age had been building up, I can explain to myself only by a co-\noperating _extra-artistic tendency_ in the essence of the recitative.\n\nThe listener, who insists on distinctly hearing the words under the music, has\nhis wishes met by the singer in that he speaks rather than sings, and\nintensifies the pathetic expression of the words in this half-song: by this\nintensification of the pathos he facilitates the understanding of the words\nand surmounts the remaining half of the music. The specific danger which now\nthreatens him is that in some unguarded moment he may give undue importance to\nmusic, which would forthwith result in the destruction of the pathos of the\nspeech and the distinctness of the words: while, on the other hand, he always\nfeels himself impelled to musical delivery and to virtuose exhibition of vocal\ntalent. Here the \"poet\" comes to his aid, who knows how to provide him with\nabundant opportunities for lyrical interjections, repetitions of words and\nsentences, etc.,\u2014at which places the singer, now in the purely musical\nelement, can rest himself without minding the words. This alternation of\nemotionally impressive, yet only half-sung speech and wholly sung\ninterjections, which is characteristic of the _stilo rappresentativo,_ this\nrapidly changing endeavour to operate now on the conceptional and\nrepresentative faculty of the hearer, now on his musical sense, is something\nso thoroughly unnatural and withal so intrinsically contradictory both to the\nApollonian and Dionysian artistic impulses, that one has to infer an origin of\nthe recitative foreign to all artistic instincts. The recitative must be\ndefined, according to this description, as the combination of epic and lyric\ndelivery, not indeed as an intrinsically stable combination which could not be\nattained in the case of such totally disparate elements, but an entirely\nsuperficial mosaic conglutination, such as is totally unprecedented in the\ndomain of nature and experience. _But this was not the opinion of the\ninventors of the recitative:_ they themselves, and their age with them,\nbelieved rather that the mystery of antique music had been solved by this\n_stilo rappresentativo,_ in which, as they thought, the only explanation of\nthe enormous influence of an Orpheus, an Amphion, and even of Greek tragedy\nwas to be found.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 249824, "end_char_idx": 254084, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "845e55b4-0ea5-4893-8b45-14d5ed7a1610": {"__data__": {"id_": "845e55b4-0ea5-4893-8b45-14d5ed7a1610", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11e7bbb4-f380-4d2a-b724-0bdf86b1b378", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "aeb08ac84a3c4636a7473de39f346a73d2a08999751ab3cf01bbab79f100626f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ca45b3cc-49a4-4f45-9fe4-d246c5b8eb46", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ebaa0b7f915d6861dd4660c212db385f2a1b8d4bc832b204217f8beea769b0cf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3a273824-fbc4-417f-ab4f-84093a5e2f0f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "622afb15783053c4c58e0fff3cd281dfdf4d61114cc6494d2164b486219a6621", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The recitative must be\ndefined, according to this description, as the combination of epic and lyric\ndelivery, not indeed as an intrinsically stable combination which could not be\nattained in the case of such totally disparate elements, but an entirely\nsuperficial mosaic conglutination, such as is totally unprecedented in the\ndomain of nature and experience. _But this was not the opinion of the\ninventors of the recitative:_ they themselves, and their age with them,\nbelieved rather that the mystery of antique music had been solved by this\n_stilo rappresentativo,_ in which, as they thought, the only explanation of\nthe enormous influence of an Orpheus, an Amphion, and even of Greek tragedy\nwas to be found. The new style was regarded by them as the re-awakening of the\nmost effective music, the Old Greek music: indeed, with the universal and\npopular conception of the Homeric world _as the primitive world,_ they could\nabandon themselves to the dream of having descended once more into the\nparadisiac beginnings of mankind, wherein music also must needs have had the\nunsurpassed purity, power, and innocence of which the poets could give such\ntouching accounts in their pastoral plays. Here we see into the internal\nprocess of development of this thoroughly modern variety of art, the opera: a\npowerful need here acquires an art, but it is a need of an un\u00e6sthetic kind:\nthe yearning for the idyll, the belief in the prehistoric existence of the\nartistic, good man. The recitative was regarded as the rediscovered language\nof this primitive man; the opera as the recovered land of this idyllically or\nheroically good creature, who in every action follows at the same time a\nnatural artistic impulse, who sings a little along with all he has to say, in\norder to sing immediately with full voice on the slightest emotional\nexcitement. It is now a matter of indifference to us that the humanists of\nthose days combated the old ecclesiastical representation of man as naturally\ncorrupt and lost, with this new-created picture of the paradisiac artist: so\nthat opera may be understood as the oppositional dogma of the good man,\nwhereby however a solace was at the same time found for the pessimism to which\nprecisely the seriously-disposed men of that time were most strongly incited,\nowing to the frightful uncertainty of all conditions of life. It is enough to\nhave perceived that the intrinsic charm, and therefore the genesis, of this\nnew form of art lies in the gratification of an altogether un\u00e6sthetic need, in\nthe optimistic glorification of man as such, in the conception of the\nprimitive man as the man naturally good and artistic: a principle of the opera\nwhich has gradually changed into a threatening and terrible _demand,_ which,\nin face of the socialistic movements of the present time, we can no longer\nignore. The \"good primitive man\" wants his rights: what paradisiac prospects!\n\nI here place by way of parallel still another equally obvious confirmation of\nmy view that opera is built up on the same principles as our Alexandrine\nculture. Opera is the birth of the theoretical man, of the critical layman,\nnot of the artist: one of the most surprising facts in the whole history of\nart. It was the demand of thoroughly unmusical hearers that the words must\nabove all be understood, so that according to them a re-birth of music is only\nto be expected when some mode of singing has been discovered in which the\ntext-word lords over the counterpoint as the master over the servant. For the\nwords, it is argued, are as much nobler than the accompanying harmonic system\nas the soul is nobler than the body. It was in accordance with the laically\nunmusical crudeness of these views that the combination of music, picture and\nexpression was effected in the beginnings of the opera: in the spirit of this\n\u00e6sthetics the first experiments were also made in the leading laic circles of\nFlorence by the poets and singers patronised there.

Because he does not divine the Dionysian depth of music, he\nchanges his musical taste into appreciation of the understandable word-and-\ntone-rhetoric of the passions in the _stilo rappresentativo,_ and into the\nvoluptuousness of the arts of song; because he is unable to behold a vision,\nhe forces the machinist and the decorative artist into his service; because he\ncannot apprehend the true nature of the artist, he conjures up the \"artistic\nprimitive man\" to suit his taste, that is, the man who sings and recites\nverses under the influence of passion. He dreams himself into a time when\npassion suffices to generate songs and poems: as if emotion had ever been able\nto create anything artistic. The postulate of the opera is a false belief\nconcerning the artistic process, in fact, the idyllic belief that every\nsentient man is an artist. In the sense of this belief, opera is the\nexpression of the taste of the laity in art, who dictate their laws with the\ncheerful optimism of the theorist.\n\nShould we desire to unite in one the two conceptions just set forth as\ninfluential in the origin of opera, it would only remain for us to speak of an\n_idyllic tendency of the opera_ : in which connection we may avail ourselves\nexclusively of the phraseology and illustration of\nSchiller.[[22]](491753352961627459_51356-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_22_25) \"Nature\nand the ideal,\" he says, \"are either objects of grief, when the former is\nrepresented as lost, the latter unattained; or both are objects of joy, in\nthat they are represented as real.

When it was not\npermitted to heroes like Goethe and Schiller to break open the enchanted gate\nwhich leads into the Hellenic magic mountain, when with their most dauntless\nstriving they did not get beyond the longing gaze which the Goethean Iphigenia\ncast from barbaric Tauris to her home across the ocean, what could the\nepigones of such heroes hope for, if the gate should not open to them suddenly\nof its own accord, in an entirely different position, quite overlooked in all\nendeavours of culture hitherto\u2014amidst the mystic tones of reawakened tragic\nmusic.\n\nLet no one attempt to weaken our faith in an impending re-birth of Hellenic\nantiquity; for in it alone we find our hope of a renovation and purification\nof the German spirit through the fire-magic of music. What else do we know of\namidst the present desolation and languor of culture, which could awaken any\ncomforting expectation for the future? We look in vain for one single\nvigorously-branching root, for a speck of fertile and healthy soil: there is\ndust, sand, torpidness and languishing everywhere! Under such circumstances a\ncheerless solitary wanderer could choose for himself no better symbol than the\nKnight with Death and the Devil, as D\u00fcrer has sketched him for us, the mail-\nclad knight, grim and stern of visage, who is able, unperturbed by his\ngruesome companions, and yet hopelessly, to pursue his terrible path with\nhorse and hound alone. Our Schopenhauer was such a D\u00fcrerian knight: he was\ndestitute of all hope, but he sought the truth.

A hurricane seizes everything\ndecrepit, decaying, collapsed, and stunted; wraps it whirlingly into a red\ncloud of dust; and carries it like a vulture into the air. Confused thereby,\nour glances seek for what has vanished: for what they see is something risen\nto the golden light as from a depression, so full and green, so luxuriantly\nalive, so ardently infinite. Tragedy sits in the midst of this exuberance of\nlife, sorrow and joy, in sublime ecstasy; she listens to a distant doleful\nsong\u2014it tells of the Mothers of Being, whose names are: _Wahn, Wille,\nWehe_[21]\u2014Yes, my friends, believe with me in Dionysian life and in the re-\nbirth of tragedy.

It is the people of the tragic mysteries\nwho fight the battles with the Persians: and again, the people who waged such\nwars required tragedy as a necessary healing potion.

If at every considerable spreading of the Dionysian commotion\none always perceives that the Dionysian loosing from the shackles of the\nindividual makes itself felt first of all in an increased encroachment on the\npolitical instincts, to the extent of indifference, yea even hostility, it is\ncertain, on the other hand, that the state-forming Apollo is also the genius\nof the _principium individuationis,_ and that the state and domestic sentiment\ncannot live without an assertion of individual personality.

For\nit holds true in all things that those whom the gods love die young, but, on\nthe other hand, it holds equally true that they then live eternally with the\ngods. One must not demand of what is most noble that it should possess the\ndurable toughness of leather; the staunch durability, which, for instance, was\ninherent in the national character of the Romans, does not probably belong to\nthe indispensable predicates of perfection. But if we ask by what physic it\nwas possible for the Greeks, in their best period, notwithstanding the\nextraordinary strength of their Dionysian and political impulses, neither to\nexhaust themselves by ecstatic brooding, nor by a consuming scramble for\nempire and worldly honour, but to attain the splendid mixture which we find in\na noble, inflaming, and contemplatively disposing wine, we must remember the\nenormous power of _tragedy,_ exciting, purifying, and disburdening the entire\nlife of a people; the highest value of which we shall divine only when, as in\nthe case of the Greeks, it appears to us as the essence of all the\nprophylactic healing forces, as the mediator arbitrating between the strongest\nand most inherently fateful characteristics of a people.\n\nTragedy absorbs the highest musical orgasm into itself, so that it absolutely\nbrings music to perfection among the Greeks, as among ourselves; but it then\nplaces alongside thereof tragic myth and the tragic hero, who, like a mighty\nTitan, takes the entire Dionysian world on his shoulders and disburdens us\nthereof; while, on the other hand, it is able by means of this same tragic\nmyth, in the person of the tragic hero, to deliver us from the intense longing\nfor this existence, and reminds us with warning hand of another existence and\na higher joy, for which the struggling hero prepares himself presentiently by\nhis destruction, not by his victories. Tragedy sets a sublime symbol, namely\nthe myth between the universal authority of its music and the receptive\nDionysian hearer, and produces in him the illusion that music is only the most\neffective means for the animation of the plastic world of myth. Relying upon\nthis noble illusion, she can now move her limbs for the dithyrambic dance, and\nabandon herself unhesitatingly to an orgiastic feeling of freedom, in which\nshe could not venture to indulge as music itself, without this illusion. The\nmyth protects us from the music, while, on the other hand, it alone gives the\nhighest freedom thereto. By way of return for this service, music imparts to\ntragic myth such an impressive and convincing metaphysical significance as\ncould never be attained by word and image, without this unique aid; and the\ntragic spectator in particular experiences thereby the sure presentiment of\nsupreme joy to which the path through destruction and negation leads; so that\nhe thinks he hears, as it were, the innermost abyss of things speaking audibly\nto him.\n\nIf in these last propositions I have succeeded in giving perhaps only a\npreliminary expression, intelligible to few at first, to this difficult\nrepresentation, I must not here desist from stimulating my friends to a\nfurther attempt, or cease from beseeching them to prepare themselves, by a\ndetached example of our common experience, for the perception of the universal\nproposition.

I have only to address\nmyself to those who, being immediately allied to music, have it as it were for\ntheir mother's lap, and are connected with things almost exclusively by\nunconscious musical relations. I ask the question of these genuine musicians:\nwhether they can imagine a man capable of hearing the third act of _Tristan\nund Isolde_ without any aid of word or scenery, purely as a vast symphonic\nperiod, without expiring by a spasmodic distention of all the wings of the\nsoul? A man who has thus, so to speak, put his ear to the heart-chamber of the\ncosmic will, who feels the furious desire for existence issuing therefrom as a\nthundering stream or most gently dispersed brook, into all the veins of the\nworld, would he not collapse all at once? Could he endure, in the wretched\nfragile tenement of the human individual, to hear the re-echo of countless\ncries of joy and sorrow from the \"vast void of cosmic night,\" without flying\nirresistibly towards his primitive home at the sound of this pastoral dance-\nsong of metaphysics? But if, nevertheless, such a work can be heard as a\nwhole, without a renunciation of individual existence, if such a creation\ncould be created without demolishing its creator\u2014where are we to get the\nsolution of this contradiction?\n\nHere there interpose between our highest musical excitement and the music in\nquestion the tragic myth and the tragic hero\u2014in reality only as symbols of the\nmost universal facts, of which music alone can speak directly. If, however, we\nfelt as purely Dionysian beings, myth as a symbol would stand by us absolutely\nineffective and unnoticed, and would never for a moment prevent us from giving\near to the re-echo of the _universalia ante rem._ Here, however, the\n_Apollonian_ power, with a view to the restoration of the well-nigh shattered\nindividual, bursts forth with the healing balm of a blissful illusion: all of\na sudden we imagine we see only Tristan, motionless, with hushed voice saying\nto himself: \"the old tune, why does it wake me?\" And what formerly interested\nus like a hollow sigh from the heart of being, seems now only to tell us how\n\"waste and void is the sea.\" And when, breathless, we thought to expire by a\nconvulsive distention of all our feelings, and only a slender tie bound us to\nour present existence, we now hear and see only the hero wounded to death and\nstill not dying, with his despairing cry: \"Longing! Longing! In dying still\nlonging! for longing not dying!\" And if formerly, after such a surplus and\nsuperabundance of consuming agonies, the jubilation of the born rent our\nhearts almost like the very acme of agony, the rejoicing Kurwenal now stands\nbetween us and the \"jubilation as such,\" with face turned toward the ship\nwhich carries Isolde. However powerfully fellow-suffering encroaches upon us,\nit nevertheless delivers us in a manner from the primordial suffering of the\nworld, just as the symbol-image of the myth delivers us from the immediate\nperception of the highest cosmic idea, just as the thought and word deliver us\nfrom the unchecked effusion of the unconscious will.

With the\nimmense potency of the image, the concept, the ethical teaching and the\nsympathetic emotion\u2014the Apollonian influence uplifts man from his orgiastic\nself-annihilation, and beguiles him concerning the universality of the\nDionysian process into the belief that he is seeing a detached picture of the\nworld, for instance, Tristan and Isolde, and that, _through music,_ he will be\nenabled to _see_ it still more clearly and intrinsically. What can the healing\nmagic of Apollo not accomplish when it can even excite in us the illusion that\nthe Dionysian is actually in the service of the Apollonian, the effects of\nwhich it is capable of enhancing; yea, that music is essentially the\nrepresentative art for an Apollonian substance?\n\nWith the pre-established harmony which obtains between perfect drama and its\nmusic, the drama attains the highest degree of conspicuousness, such as is\nusually unattainable in mere spoken drama. As all the animated figures of the\nscene in the independently evolved lines of melody simplify themselves before\nus to the distinctness of the catenary curve, the coexistence of these lines\nis also audible in the harmonic change which sympathises in a most delicate\nmanner with the evolved process: through which change the relations of things\nbecome immediately perceptible to us in a sensible and not at all abstract\nmanner, as we likewise perceive thereby that it is only in these relations\nthat the essence of a character and of a line of melody manifests itself\nclearly. And while music thus compels us to see more extensively and more\nintrinsically than usual, and makes us spread out the curtain of the scene\nbefore ourselves like some delicate texture, the world of the stage is as\ninfinitely expanded for our spiritualised, introspective eye as it is\nillumined outwardly from within. How can the word-poet furnish anything\nanalogous, who strives to attain this internal expansion and illumination of\nthe visible stage-world by a much more imperfect mechanism and an indirect\npath, proceeding as he does from word and concept? Albeit musical tragedy\nlikewise avails itself of the word, it is at the same time able to place\nalongside thereof its basis and source, and can make the unfolding of the\nword, from within outwards, obvious to us.\n\nOf the process just set forth, however, it could still be said as decidedly\nthat it is only a glorious appearance, namely the afore-mentioned Apollonian\n_illusion,_ through the influence of which we are to be delivered from the\nDionysian obtrusion and excess.

The drama, which, by the aid of music, spreads out before us with\nsuch inwardly illumined distinctness in all its movements and figures, that we\nimagine we see the texture unfolding on the loom as the shuttle flies to and\nfro,\u2014attains as a whole an effect which _transcends all Apollonian artistic\neffects._ In the collective effect of tragedy, the Dionysian gets the upper\nhand once more; tragedy ends with a sound which could never emanate from the\nrealm of Apollonian art. And the Apollonian illusion is thereby found to be\nwhat it is,\u2014the assiduous veiling during the performance of tragedy of the\nintrinsically Dionysian effect: which, however, is so powerful, that it\nfinally forces the Apollonian drama itself into a sphere where it begins to\ntalk with Dionysian wisdom, and even denies itself and its Apollonian\nconspicuousness. Thus then the intricate relation of the Apollonian and the\nDionysian in tragedy must really be symbolised by a fraternal union of the two\ndeities: Dionysus speaks the language of Apollo; Apollo, however, finally\nspeaks the language of Dionysus; and so the highest goal of tragedy and of art\nin general is attained.\n\n#### 22.\n\nLet the attentive friend picture to himself purely and simply, according to\nhis experiences, the effect of a true musical tragedy.

While he thus becomes conscious\nof the highest exaltation of his instincts for conspicuousness and\ntransfiguration, he nevertheless feels with equal definitiveness that this\nlong series of Apollonian artistic effects still does _not_ generate the\nblissful continuance in will-less contemplation which the plasticist and the\nepic poet, that is to say, the strictly Apollonian artists, produce in him by\ntheir artistic productions: to wit, the justification of the world of the\n_individuatio_ attained in this contemplation,\u2014which is the object and essence\nof Apollonian art. He beholds the transfigured world of the stage and\nnevertheless denies it. He sees before him the tragic hero in epic clearness\nand beauty, and nevertheless delights in his annihilation.

Whence must we derive this\ncurious internal dissension, this collapse of the Apollonian apex, if not from\nthe _Dionysian_ spell, which, though apparently stimulating the Apollonian\nemotions to their highest pitch, can nevertheless force this superabundance of\nApollonian power into its service? _Tragic myth_ is to be understood only as a\nsymbolisation of Dionysian wisdom by means of the expedients of Apollonian\nart: the mythus conducts the world of phenomena to its boundaries, where it\ndenies itself, and seeks to flee back again into the bosom of the true and\nonly reality; where it then, like Isolde, seems to strike up its metaphysical\nswan-song:\u2014\n\nIn des Wonnemeeres  \nwogendem Schwall,  \nin der Duft-Wellen  \nt\u00f6nendem Schall,  \nin des Weltathems  \nwehendem All\u2014  \nertrinken\u2014versinken  \nunbewusst\u2014h\u00f6chste\nLust![[24]](491753352961627459_51356-h-6.htm.html#Footnote_24_27)  \n\nWe thus realise to ourselves in the experiences of the truly \u00e6sthetic hearer\nthe tragic artist himself when he proceeds like a luxuriously fertile divinity\nof individuation to create his figures (in which sense his work can hardly be\nunderstood as an \"imitation of nature\")\u2014and when, on the other hand, his vast\nDionysian impulse then absorbs the entire world of phenomena, in order to\nanticipate beyond it, and through its annihilation, the highest artistic\nprimal joy, in the bosom of the Primordial Unity.

Never since Aristotle has an explanation of the tragic effect been\nproposed, by which an \u00e6sthetic activity of the hearer could be inferred from\nartistic circumstances. At one time fear and pity are supposed to be forced to\nan alleviating discharge through the serious procedure, at another time we are\nexpected to feel elevated and inspired at the triumph of good and noble\nprinciples, at the sacrifice of the hero in the interest of a moral conception\nof things; and however certainly I believe that for countless men precisely\nthis, and only this, is the effect of tragedy, it as obviously follows\ntherefrom that all these, together with their interpreting \u00e6sthetes, have had\nno experience of tragedy as the highest _art._ The pathological discharge, the\ncatharsis of Aristotle, which philologists are at a loss whether to include\nunder medicinal or moral phenomena, recalls a remarkable anticipation of\nGoethe. \"Without a lively pathological interest,\" he says, \"I too have never\nyet succeeded in elaborating a tragic situation of any kind, and hence I have\nrather avoided than sought it. Can it perhaps have been still another of the\nmerits of the ancients that the deepest pathos was with them merely \u00e6sthetic\nplay, whereas with us the truth of nature must co-operate in order to produce\nsuch a work?\" We can now answer in the affirmative this latter profound\nquestion after our glorious experiences, in which we have found to our\nastonishment in the case of musical tragedy itself, that the deepest pathos\ncan in reality be merely \u00e6sthetic play: and therefore we are justified in\nbelieving that now for the first time the proto-phenomenon of the tragic can\nbe portrayed with some degree of success. He who now will still persist in\ntalking only of those vicarious effects proceeding from ultra-\u00e6sthetic\nspheres, and does not feel himself raised above the pathologically-moral\nprocess, may be left to despair of his \u00e6sthetic nature: for which we recommend\nto him, by way of innocent equivalent, the interpretation of Shakespeare after\nthe fashion of Gervinus, and the diligent search for poetic justice.\n\nThus with the re-birth of tragedy the _\u00e6sthetic hearer_ is also born anew, in\nwhose place in the theatre a curious _quid pro quo_ was wont to sit with half-\nmoral and half-learned pretensions,\u2014the \"critic.\" In his sphere hitherto\neverything has been artificial and merely glossed over with a semblance of\nlife. The performing artist was in fact at a loss what to do with such a\ncritically comporting hearer, and hence he, as well as the dramatist or\noperatic composer who inspired him, searched anxiously for the last remains of\nlife in a being so pretentiously barren and incapable of enjoyment. Such\n\"critics,\" however, have hitherto constituted the public; the student, the\nschool-boy, yea, even the most harmless womanly creature, were already\nunwittingly prepared by education and by journals for a similar perception of\nworks of art. The nobler natures among the artists counted upon exciting the\nmoral-religious forces in such a public, and the appeal to a moral order of\nthe world operated vicariously, when in reality some powerful artistic spell\nshould have enraptured the true hearer.

While the critic got\nthe upper hand in the theatre and concert-hall, the journalist in the school,\nand the press in society, art degenerated into a topic of conversation of the\nmost trivial kind, and \u00e6sthetic criticism was used as the cement of a vain,\ndistracted, selfish and moreover piteously unoriginal sociality, the\nsignificance of which is suggested by the Schopenhauerian parable of the\nporcupines, so that there has never been so much gossip about art and so\nlittle esteem for it.

For the rectification of our \u00e6sthetic knowledge we\npreviously borrowed from them the two divine figures, each of which sways a\nseparate realm of art, and concerning whose mutual contact and exaltation we\nhave acquired a notion through Greek tragedy. Through a remarkable disruption\nof both these primitive artistic impulses, the ruin of Greek tragedy seemed to\nbe necessarily brought about: with which process a degeneration and a\ntransmutation of the Greek national character was strictly in keeping,\nsummoning us to earnest reflection as to how closely and necessarily art and\nthe people, myth and custom, tragedy and the state, have coalesced in their\nbases. The ruin of tragedy was at the same time the ruin of myth. Until then\nthe Greeks had been involuntarily compelled immediately to associate all\nexperiences with their myths, indeed they had to comprehend them only through\nthis association: whereby even the most immediate present necessarily appeared\nto them _sub specie \u00e6terni_ and in a certain sense as timeless. Into this\ncurrent of the timeless, however, the state as well as art plunged in order to\nfind repose from the burden and eagerness of the moment. And a people\u2014for the\nrest, also a man\u2014is worth just as much only as its ability to impress on its\nexperiences the seal of eternity: for it is thus, as it were, desecularised,\nand reveals its unconscious inner conviction of the relativity of time and of\nthe true, that is, the metaphysical significance of life. The contrary happens\nwhen a people begins to comprehend itself historically and to demolish the\nmythical bulwarks around it: with which there is usually connected a marked\nsecularisation, a breach with the unconscious metaphysics of its earlier\nexistence, in all ethical consequences. Greek art and especially Greek tragedy\ndelayed above all the annihilation of myth: it was necessary to annihilate\nthese also to be able to live detached from the native soil, unbridled in the\nwilderness of thought, custom, and action. Even in such circumstances this\nmetaphysical impulse still endeavours to create for itself a form of\napotheosis (weakened, no doubt) in the Socratism of science urging to life:\nbut on its lower stage this same impulse led only to a feverish search, which\ngradually merged into a pandemonium of myths and superstitions accumulated\nfrom all quarters: in the midst of which, nevertheless, the Hellene sat with a\nyearning heart till he contrived, as Gr\u00e6culus, to mask his fever with Greek\ncheerfulness and Greek levity, or to narcotise himself completely with some\ngloomy Oriental superstition.\n\nWe have approached this condition in the most striking manner since the\nreawakening of the Alexandro\u2014Roman antiquity in the fifteenth century, after a\nlong, not easily describable, interlude.

Our opinion of the pure and vigorous kernel\nof the German being is such that we venture to expect of it, and only of it,\nthis elimination of forcibly ingrafted foreign elements, and we deem it\npossible that the German spirit will reflect anew on itself. Perhaps many a\none will be of opinion that this spirit must begin its struggle with the\nelimination of the Romanic element: for which it might recognise an external\npreparation and encouragement in the victorious bravery and bloody glory of\nthe late war, but must seek the inner constraint in the emulative zeal to be\nfor ever worthy of the sublime protagonists on this path, of Luther as well as\nour great artists and poets.

It\nthereby seemed to us that precisely through this discharge the middle world of\ntheatrical procedure, the drama generally, became visible and intelligible\nfrom within in a degree unattainable in the other forms of Apollonian art: so\nthat here, where this art was as it were winged and borne aloft by the spirit\nof music, we had to recognise the highest exaltation of its powers, and\nconsequently in the fraternal union of Apollo and Dionysus the climax of the\nApollonian as well as of the Dionysian artistic aims.\n\nOf course, the Apollonian light-picture did not, precisely with this inner\nillumination through music, attain the peculiar effect of the weaker grades of\nApollonian art.

It shares with the\nApollonian sphere of art the full delight in appearance and contemplation, and\nat the same time it denies this delight and finds a still higher satisfaction\nin the annihilation of the visible world of appearance. The substance of\ntragic myth is first of all an epic event involving the glorification of the\nfighting hero: but whence originates the essentially enigmatical trait, that\nthe suffering in the fate of the hero, the most painful victories, the most\nagonising contrasts of motives, in short, the exemplification of the wisdom of\nSilenus, or, \u00e6sthetically expressed, the Ugly and Discordant, is always\nrepresented anew in such countless forms with such predilection, and precisely\nin the most youthful and exuberant age of a people, unless there is really a\nhigher delight experienced in all this?\n\nFor the fact that things actually take such a tragic course would least of all\nexplain the origin of a form of art; provided that art is not merely an\nimitation of the reality of nature, but in truth a metaphysical supplement to\nthe reality of nature, placed alongside thereof for its conquest. Tragic myth,\nin so far as it really belongs to art, also fully participates in this\ntransfiguring metaphysical purpose of art in general: What does it\ntransfigure, however, when it presents the phenomenal world in the guise of\nthe suffering hero? Least of all the \"reality\" of this phenomenal world, for\nit says to us: \"Look at this! Look carefully! It is your life! It is the hour-\nhand of your clock of existence!\"\n\nAnd myth has displayed this life, in order thereby to transfigure it to us? If\nnot, how shall we account for the \u00e6sthetic pleasure with which we make even\nthese representations pass before us? I am inquiring concerning the \u00e6sthetic\npleasure, and am well aware that many of these representations may moreover\noccasionally create even a moral delectation, say under the form of pity or of\na moral triumph. But he who would derive the effect of the tragic exclusively\nfrom these moral sources, as was usually the case far too long in \u00e6sthetics,\nlet him not think that he has done anything for Art thereby; for Art must\nabove all insist on purity in her domain. For the explanation of tragic myth\nthe very first requirement is that the pleasure which characterises it must be\nsought in the purely \u00e6sthetic sphere, without encroaching on the domain of\npity, fear, or the morally-sublime. How can the ugly and the discordant, the\nsubstance of tragic myth, excite an \u00e6sthetic pleasure?\n\nHere it is necessary to raise ourselves with a daring bound into a metaphysics\nof Art. I repeat, therefore, my former proposition, that it is only as an\n\u00e6sthetic phenomenon that existence and the world, appear justified: and in\nthis sense it is precisely the function of tragic myth to convince us that\neven the Ugly and Discordant is an artistic game which the will, in the\neternal fulness of its joy, plays with itself. But this not easily\ncomprehensible proto-phenomenon of Dionysian Art becomes, in a direct way,\nsingularly intelligible, and is immediately apprehended in the wonderful\nsignificance of _musical dissonance:_ just as in general it is music alone,\nplaced in contrast to the world, which can give us an idea as to what is meant\nby the justification of the world as an \u00e6sthetic phenomenon.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 310922, "end_char_idx": 315180, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "87e5ea8b-2f36-4458-af12-4c2f3abebde6": {"__data__": {"id_": "87e5ea8b-2f36-4458-af12-4c2f3abebde6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11e7bbb4-f380-4d2a-b724-0bdf86b1b378", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "aeb08ac84a3c4636a7473de39f346a73d2a08999751ab3cf01bbab79f100626f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e0eb458a-16bc-4c82-8fd6-5b78efd5c1f0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/tragedy/birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_name": "birth_of_tragedy.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 184266, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "a1d9a4e7b4860b80ea81766b0668f748999c5bef10c6d3708c68cbb2c2034a88", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "51a86d82-12b3-431d-88c3-6057a50c638f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8ad2ff5e2c4a18aa2720453c4df80638c780e2b89a8e31d3af0cc0a99b00b8bd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Here it is necessary to raise ourselves with a daring bound into a metaphysics\nof Art.

The joy that the\ntragic myth excites has the same origin as the joyful sensation of dissonance\nin music. The Dionysian, with its primitive joy experienced in pain itself, is\nthe common source of music and tragic myth.\n\nIs it not possible that by calling to our aid the musical relation of\ndissonance, the difficult problem of tragic effect may have meanwhile been\nmaterially facilitated? For we now understand what it means to wish to view\ntragedy and at the same time to have a longing beyond the viewing: a frame of\nmind, which, as regards the artistically employed dissonance, we should simply\nhave to characterise by saying that we desire to hear and at the same time\nhave a longing beyond the hearing. That striving for the infinite, the pinion-\nflapping of longing, accompanying the highest delight in the clearly-perceived\nreality, remind one that in both states we have to recognise a Dionysian\nphenomenon, which again and again reveals to us anew the playful up-building\nand demolishing of the world of individuals as the efflux of a primitive\ndelight, in like manner as when Heraclitus the Obscure compares the world-\nbuilding power to a playing child which places stones here and there and\nbuilds sandhills only to overthrow them again.\n\nHence, in order to form a true estimate of the Dionysian capacity of a people,\nit would seem that we must think not only of their music, but just as much of\ntheir tragic myth, the second witness of this capacity. Considering this most\nintimate relationship between music and myth, we may now in like manner\nsuppose that a degeneration and depravation of the one involves a\ndeterioration of the other: if it be true at all that the weakening of the\nmyth is generally expressive of a debilitation of the Dionysian capacity.\nConcerning both, however, a glance at the development of the German genius\nshould not leave us in any doubt; in the opera just as in the abstract\ncharacter of our myth-less existence, in an art sunk to pastime just as in a\nlife guided by concepts, the inartistic as well as life-consuming nature of\nSocratic optimism had revealed itself to us. Yet there have been indications\nto console us that nevertheless in some inaccessible abyss the German spirit\nstill rests and dreams, undestroyed, in glorious health, profundity, and\nDionysian strength, like a knight sunk in slumber: from which abyss the\nDionysian song rises to us to let us know that this German knight even still\ndreams his primitive Dionysian myth in blissfully earnest visions. Let no one\nbelieve that the German spirit has for ever lost its mythical home when it\nstill understands so obviously the voices of the birds which tell of that\nhome. Some day it will find itself awake in all the morning freshness of a\ndeep sleep: then it will slay the dragons, destroy the malignant dwarfs, and\nwaken Br\u00fcnnhilde\u2014and Wotan's spear itself will be unable to obstruct its\ncourse!\n\nMy friends, ye who believe in Dionysian music, ye know also what tragedy means\nto us.

Both originate in an ultra\nApollonian sphere of art; both transfigure a region in the delightful accords\nof which all dissonance, just like the terrible picture of the world, dies\ncharmingly away; both play with the sting of displeasure, trusting to their\nmost potent magic; both justify thereby the existence even of the \"worst\nworld.\" Here the Dionysian, as compared with the Apollonian, exhibits itself\nas the eternal and original artistic force, which in general calls into\nexistence the entire world of phenomena: in the midst of which a new\ntransfiguring appearance becomes necessary, in order to keep alive the\nanimated world of individuation. If we could conceive an incarnation of\ndissonance\u2014and what is man but that?\u2014then, to be able to live this dissonance\nwould require a glorious illusion which would spread a veil of beauty over its\npeculiar nature. This is the true function of Apollo as deity of art: in whose\nname we comprise all the countless manifestations of the fair realm of\nillusion, which each moment render life in general worth living and make one\nimpatient for the experience of the next moment.\n\nAt the same time, just as much of this basis of all existence\u2014the Dionysian\nsubstratum of the world\u2014is allowed to enter into the consciousness of human\nbeings, as can be surmounted again by the Apollonian transfiguring power, so\nthat these two art-impulses are constrained to develop their powers in\nstrictly mutual proportion, according to the law of eternal justice. When the\nDionysian powers rise with such vehemence as we experience at present, there\ncan be no doubt that, veiled in a cloud, Apollo has already descended to us;\nwhose grandest beautifying influences a coming generation will perhaps behold.\n\nThat this effect is necessary, however, each one would most surely perceive by\nintuition, if once he found himself carried back\u2014even in a dream\u2014into an Old-\nHellenic existence. In walking under high Ionic colonnades, looking upwards to\na horizon defined by clear and noble lines, with reflections of his\ntransfigured form by his side in shining marble, and around him solemnly\nmarching or quietly moving men, with harmoniously sounding voices and\nrhythmical pantomime, would he not in the presence of this perpetual influx of\nbeauty have to raise his hand to Apollo and exclaim: \"Blessed race of\nHellenes! How great Dionysus must be among you, when the Delian god deems such\ncharms necessary to cure you of your dithyrambic madness!\"\u2014To one in this\nframe of mind, however, an aged Athenian, looking up to him with the sublime\neye of \u00c6schylus, might answer: \"Say also this, thou curious stranger: what\nsufferings this people must have undergone, in order to be able to become thus\nbeautiful! But now follow me to a tragic play, and sacrifice with me in the\ntemple of both the deities!\"\n\n* * *\n\n#### APPENDIX.\n\n[Late in the year 1888, not long before he was overcome by his sudden attack\nof insanity, Nietzsche wrote down a few notes concerning his early work, the\n_Birth of Tragedy._ These were printed in his sister's biography (_Das Leben\nFriedrich Nietzsches,_ vol. ii. pt. i. pp. 102 ff.), and are here translated\nas likely to be of interest to readers of this remarkable work.

It has _wrought effects,_ it even fascinated through that wherein it\nwas amiss\u2014through its application to _Wagnerism,_ just as if this Wagnerism\nwere symptomatic of _a rise and going up._ And just on that account was the\nbook an event in Wagner's life: from thence and only from thence were great\nhopes linked to the name of Wagner. Even to-day people remind me, sometimes\nright in the midst of a talk on _Parsifal,_ that _I_ and none other have it on\nmy conscience that such a high opinion of the _cultural value_ of this\nmovement came to the top. More than once have I found the book referred to as\n'the _Re_ -birth of Tragedy out of the Spirit of Music': one only had an ear\nfor a new formula of _Wagner's_ art, aim, task,\u2014and failed to hear withal what\nwas at bottom valuable therein. 'Hellenism and Pessimism' had been a more\nunequivocal title: namely, as a first lesson on the way in which the Greeks\ngot the better of pessimism,\u2014on the means whereby they _overcame_ it. Tragedy\nsimply proves that the Greeks were _no_ pessimists: Schopenhauer was mistaken\nhere as he was mistaken in all other things. Considered with some neutrality,\nthe _Birth of Tragedy_ appears very unseasonable: one would not even dream\nthat it was _begun_ amid the thunders of the battle of W\u00f6rth. I thought these\nproblems through and through before the walls of Metz in cold September\nnights, in the midst of the work of nursing the sick; one might even believe\nthe book to be fifty years older. It is politically indifferent\u2014un-German one\nwill say to-day,\u2014it smells shockingly Hegelian, in but a few formul\u00e6 does it\nscent of Schopenhauer's funereal perfume. An 'idea'\u2014the antithesis of\n'Dionysian _versus_ Apollonian'\u2014translated into metaphysics; history itself as\nthe evolution of this 'idea'; the antithesis dissolved into oneness in\nTragedy; through this optics things that had never yet looked into one\nanother's face, confronted of a sudden, and illumined and _comprehended_\nthrough one another: for instance, Opera and Revolution. The two decisive\n_innovations_ of the book are, on the one hand, the comprehension of the\n_Dionysian_ phenomenon among the Greeks (it gives the first psychology\nthereof, it sees therein the One root of all Grecian art); on the other, the\ncomprehension of Socratism: Socrates diagnosed for the first time as the tool\nof Grecian dissolution, as a typical decadent. 'Rationality' _against_\ninstinct! 'Rationality' at any price as a dangerous, as a life-undermining\nforce! Throughout the whole book a deep hostile silence on Christianity: it is\nneither Apollonian nor Dionysian; it _negatives_ all _\u00e6sthetic_ values (the\nonly values recognised by the _Birth of Tragedy),_ it is in the widest sense\nnihilistic, whereas in the Dionysian symbol the utmost limit of _affirmation_\nis reached.

I had for my own inmost experience\n_discovered_ the only symbol and counterpart of history,\u2014I had just thereby\nbeen the first to grasp the wonderful phenomenon of the Dionysian. And again,\nthrough my diagnosing Socrates as a decadent, I had given a wholly unequivocal\nproof of how little risk the trustworthiness of my psychological grasp would\nrun of being weakened by some moralistic idiosyncrasy\u2014to view morality itself\nas a symptom of decadence is an innovation, a novelty of the first rank in the\nhistory of knowledge. How far I had leaped in either case beyond the smug\nshallow-pate-gossip of optimism _contra_ pessimism! I was the first to see the\nintrinsic antithesis: here, the _degenerating_ instinct which, with\nsubterranean vindictiveness, turns against life (Christianity, the philosophy\nof Schopenhauer, in a certain sense already the philosophy of Plato, all\nidealistic systems as typical forms), and there, a formula of _highest\naffirmation,_ born of fullness and overfullness, a yea-saying without reserve\nto suffering's self, to guilt's self, to all that is questionable and strange\nin existence itself. This final, cheerfullest, exuberantly mad-and-merriest\nYea to life is not only the highest insight, it is also the _deepest,_ it is\nthat which is most rigorously confirmed and upheld by truth and science.\nNaught that is, is to be deducted, naught is dispensable; the phases of\nexistence rejected by the Christians and other nihilists are even of an\ninfinitely higher order in the hierarchy of values than that which the\ninstinct of decadence sanctions, yea durst _sanction._ To comprehend this\n_courage_ is needed, and, as a condition thereof, a surplus of _strength_ :\nfor precisely in degree as courage _dares_ to thrust forward, precisely\naccording to the measure of strength, does one approach truth. Perception, the\nyea-saying to reality, is as much a necessity to the strong as to the weak,\nunder the inspiration of weakness, cowardly shrinking, and _flight_ from\nreality\u2014the 'ideal.' ... They are not free to perceive: the decadents have\n_need_ of the lie,\u2014it is one of their conditions of self-preservation. Whoso\nnot only comprehends the word Dionysian, but also grasps his _self_ in this\nword, requires no refutation of Plato or of Christianity or of Schopenhauer\u2014\n_he smells the putrefaction._ \"\n\n#### 3.\n\n\"To what extent I had just thereby found the concept 'tragic,' the definitive\nperception of the  psychology of tragedy, I have but lately stated in the\n_Twilight of the Idols,_ page 139 (1st edit.): 'The affirmation of life, even\nin its most unfamiliar and severe problems, the will to life, enjoying its own\ninexhaustibility in the sacrifice of its highest types,\u2014 _that_ is what I\ncalled Dionysian, that is what I divined as the bridge to a psychology of the\n_tragic_ poet.

In fine, I see no reason whatever for\ntaking back my hope of a Dionysian future for music. Let us cast a glance a\ncentury ahead, let us suppose my assault upon two millenniums of anti-nature\nand man-vilification succeeds! That new party of life which will take in hand\nthe greatest of all tasks, the upbreeding of mankind to something higher,\u2014add\nthereto the relentless annihilation of all things degenerating and parasitic,\nwill again make possible on earth that _too-much of life,_ from which there\nalso must needs grow again the Dionysian state. I promise a _tragic_ age: the\nhighest art in the yea-saying to life, tragedy, will be born anew, when\nmankind have behind them the consciousness of the hardest but most necessary\nwars, _without suffering therefrom._ A psychologist might still add that what\nI heard in my younger years in Wagnerian music had in general naught to do\nwith Wagner; that when I described Wagnerian music I described what _I_ had\nheard, that I had instinctively to translate and transfigure all into the new\nspirit which I bore within myself....\"\n\n[[1]](491753352961627459_51356-h-6.htm.html#FNanchor_1_28) Mr. Common's\ntranslation, pp. 227-28.\n\n[[2]](491753352961627459_51356-h-6.htm.html#FNanchor_2_29) Greek: \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03ac.\n\n* * *\n\n#### TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.\n\nWhile the translator flatters himself that this version of Nietzsche's early\nwork\u2014having been submitted to unsparingly scrutinising eyes\u2014is not altogether\nunworthy of the original, he begs to state that he holds twentieth-century\nEnglish to be a rather unsatisfactory vehicle for philosophical thought.\nAccordingly, in conjunction with his friend Dr. Ernest Lacy, he has prepared a\nsecond, more unconventional translation,\u2014in brief, a translation which will\nenable one whose knowledge of English extends to, say, the period of\nElizabeth, to appreciate Nietzsche in more forcible language, because the\nlanguage of a stronger age.

Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3)\neducational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi\nand granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The\nFoundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541.\nContributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax\ndeductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\u2019s\nlaws.\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake\nCity, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation\u2019s website and official page at\nwww.gutenberg.org/contact\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public\nsupport and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of\npublic domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-\nreadable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated\nequipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to\nmaintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities\nand charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance\nrequirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much\npaperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not\nsolicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation\nof compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit\n[www.gutenberg.org/donate](https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/).\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not\nmet the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting\nunsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers\nto donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the\nUnited States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and\naddresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks,\nonline payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit:\nwww.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg\u2122 concept\nof a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For\nforty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a\nloose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all\nof which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a\ncopyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in\ncompliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search facility:\n[www.gutenberg.org](https://www.gutenberg.org).\n\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122, including how to\nmake donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to\nhelp produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to\nhear about new eBooks.\n\n\n![Cover](946183233848949245_cover.jpg)", "mimetype": "text/plain",
