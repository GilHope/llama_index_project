During September and the early part of October 1888, Nietzsche added to\nthe original contents of the book by inserting the whole section entitled\n\u201cThings the Germans Lack,\u201d and aphorisms 32-43 of \u201cSkirmishes in a War with\nthe Age\u201d; and the book, as it now stands, represents exactly the form in which\nNietzsche intended to publish it in the course of the year 1889. Unfortunately\nits author was already stricken down with illness when the work first appeared\nat the end of January 1889, and he was denied the joy of seeing it run into\nnine editions, of one thousand each, before his death in 1900.\n\nOf _The Twilight of the Idols,_ Nietzsche says in _Ecce Homo_ (p. 118):\u2014\u201cIf\nanyone should desire to obtain a rapid sketch of how everything before my time\nwas standing on its head, he should begin reading me in this book. That which\nis called \u2018Idols\u2019 on the title-page is simply the old truth that has been\nbelieved in hitherto. In plain English, _The Twilight of the Idols_ means that\nthe old truth is on its last legs.\u201d\n\nCertain it is that, for a rapid survey of the whole of Nietzsche\u2019s doctrine,\nno book, save perhaps the section entitled \u201cOf Old and New Tables\u201d in _Thus\nSpake Zarathustra,_ could be of more real value than _The Twilight of the\nIdols._ Here Nietzsche is quite at his best. He is ripe for the marvellous\nfeat of the transvaluation of all values. Nowhere is his language\u2014that\nmarvellous weapon which in his hand became at once so supple and so\nmurderous\u2014more forcible and more condensed. Nowhere are his thoughts more\nprofound. But all this does not by any means imply that this book is the\neasiest of Nietzsche\u2019s works. On the contrary, I very much fear that, unless\nthe reader is well prepared, not only in Nietzscheism, but also in the habit\nof grappling with uncommon and elusive problems, a good deal of the contents\nof this work will tend rather to confuse than to enlighten him in regard to\nwhat Nietzsche actually wishes to make clear in these pages.\n\nHow much prejudice, for instance, how many traditional and deep-seated\nopinions, must be uprooted, if we are to see even so much as an important note\nof interrogation in the section entitled \u201cThe Problem of Socrates\u201d\u2014not to\nspeak of such sections as \u201cMorality as the Enemy of Nature,\u201d \u201cThe Four Great\nErrors,\u201d &c. The errors exposed in these sections have a tradition of two\nthousand years behind them; and only a fantastic dreamer could expect them to\nbe eradicated by a mere casual study of these pages. Indeed, Nietzsche himself\nlooked forward only to a gradual change in the general view of the questions\nhe discussed; he knew only too well what the conversion of \u201clight heads\u201d was\nworth, and what kind of man would probably be the first to rush into his arms;\nand, grand psychologist that he was, he guarded himself beforehand against bad\ncompany by means of his famous warning:\u2014\u201cThe first adherents of a creed do not\nprove anything against it.\u201d\n\nTo the aspiring student of Nietzsche, however, it ought not to be necessary to\nbecome an immediate convert in order to be interested in the treasure of\nthought which Nietzsche here lavishes upon us. For such a man it will be quite\ndifficult enough to regard the questions raised in this work as actual\nproblems. Once, however, he has succeeded in doing this, and has given his\nimagination time to play round these questions _as_ problems, the particular\nturn or twist that Nietzsche gives to their elucidation, may then perhaps\nstrike him, not only as valuable, but as absolutely necessary.\n\nWith regard to the substance of _The Twilight of the Idols,_ Nietzsche says in\n_Ecce Homo_ (p. 119):\u2014\u201cThere is the waste of an all-too-rich autumn in this\nbook: you trip over truths.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3149, "end_char_idx": 7225, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2174f91a-c3c0-4b4f-b187-9eabc226f751": {"__data__": {"id_": "2174f91a-c3c0-4b4f-b187-9eabc226f751", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "52ce8356-28ca-4fd0-8eb5-1ff3aabc8a3b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ccacc582c0a976ac41dcb5ef4cb24995eba34bf63d001bc0cdd72802091e1e89", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "766146fc-09b3-402d-80c4-f61d4cfd8161", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "7ebbb25e684ecdbc64bd2c174f79fefbcf96c5b01f4e0ce2224d1e01d21fcc81", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0c02d1a6-c467-49af-b4a0-ce1704e8c6ac", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "348d7ed532a0b181e31befdb109f135a2917dddf86fee3b2dc37dc6a0f78cfd2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "For such a man it will be quite\ndifficult enough to regard the questions raised in this work as actual\nproblems.

You even crush some to death, there are too many\nof them.\u201d\n\nAnd what are these truths? They are things that are not yet held to be true.\nThey are the utterances of a man who, as a single exception, escaped for a\nwhile the general insanity of Europe, with its blind idealism in the midst of\nsqualor, with its unscrupulous praise of so-called \u201cProgress\u201d while it stood\nknee-deep in the belittlement of \u201cMan,\u201d and with its vulgar levity in the face\nof effeminacy and decay;\u2014they are the utterances of one who voiced the hopes,\nthe aims, and the realities of another world, not of an ideal world, not of a\nworld beyond, but of a real world, of _this_ world regenerated and reorganised\nupon a sounder, a more virile, and a more orderly basis,\u2014in fact, of a\nperfectly _possible_ world, one that has already existed in the past, and\ncould exist again, if only the stupendous revolution of a transvaluation of\nall values were made possible.\n\nThis then is the nature of the truths uttered by this one sane man in the\nwhole of Europe at the end of last century; and when, owing to his unequal\nstruggle against the overwhelming hostile forces of his time, his highly\nsensitive personality was at last forced to surrender itself to the enemy and\nbecome one with them\u2014that is to say, insane!\u2014at least the record of his sanity\nhad been safely stored away, beyond the reach of time and change, in the\nvolumes which constitute his life-work.\n\n* * *\n\nNietzsche must have started upon the \u201cAntichrist,\u201d immediately after having\ndispatched the \u201cIdle Hours of a Psychologist\u201d to the printers, and the work\nappears to have been finished at the end of September 1888\\. It was intended\nby Nietzsche to form the first book of a large work entitled \u201cThe\nTransvaluation of all Values\u201d; but, though this work was never completed, we\ncan form some idea from the substance of the \u201cAntichrist\u201d and from the titles\nof the remaining three books, which alas! were never written, of what its\ncontents would have been. These titles are:\u2014Book II. The Free Spirit. A\nCriticism of Philosophy as a Nihilistic Movement. Book III. The Immoralist. A\nCriticism of the most Fatal Kind of Ignorance,\u2014Morality. Book IV. Dionysus.\nThe Philosophy of Eternal Recurrence.\n\nNietzsche calls this book \u201cAn Attempted Criticism of Christianity.\u201d Modest as\nthis sub-title is, it will probably seem not quite modest enough to those who\nthink that Nietzsche fell far short of doing justice to their Holy Creed. Be\nthis as it may, there is the solution of a certain profound problem in this\nbook, which, while it is the key to all Nietzscheism, is also the\njustification and the sanctification of Nietzsche\u2019s cause.

Thus it is necessary that something should be assumed to be\ntrue, _not_ that it is true;\u201d\u2014remembering these words, as I say, the reader\nmay stand somewhat aghast before all those passages in the second half of this\nvolume, where the very falsehoods of Christianity, its assumptions, its\nunwarrantable claims to Truth, are declared to be pernicious, base and\ncorrupt.\n\nAgain and again, if we commit the error of supposing that Nietzsche believed\nin a truth that was absolute, we shall find throughout his works reasons for\ncharging him with apparently the very same crimes that he here lays at the\ndoor of Christianity. What then is the explanation of his seeming\ninconsistency?\n\nIt is simple enough. Nietzsche\u2019s charge of falsehood against Christianity is\nnot a moral one,\u2014in fact it may be taken as a general rule that Nietzsche\nscrupulously avoids making moral charges, and that he emains throughout\nfaithful to his position Beyond Good and Evil (see, for instance [Aph.\n6](1418498124915300953_52263-h-3.htm.html#Page_130)(Antichrist) where he\nrepudiates all moral prejudice in charging humanity with corruption). A man\nwho maintained that \u201ctruth is that form of error which enables a particular\nspecies to prevail,\u201d could not make a _moral_ charge of falsehood against any\none, or any institution; but he could do so from another standpoint He could\nwell say, for instance, \u201cfalsehood is that kind of error which causes a\nparticular species to degenerate and to decay.\u201d\n\nThus the fact that Christianity \u201clied\u201d becomes a subject of alarm to\nNietzsche, not owing to the fact that it is immoral to lie, but because in\nthis particular instance, the lie was harmful, hostile to life, and dangerous\nto humanity; for \u201ca belief might be false and yet life-preserving\u201d (_Beyond\nGood and Evil,_ pp. 8, 9).\n\nSuppose, therefore, we say with Nietzsche that there is no absolute truth, but\nthat all that has been true in the past which has been the means of making the\n\u201cplant man flourish best\u201d\u2014or, since the meaning of \u201cbest\u201d is open to some\ndebate, let us say, flourish in a Nietzschean sense, that is to say, thanks to\na mastery of life, and to a preponderance of all those qualities which say yea\nto existence, and which suggest no flight from this world and all its pleasure\nand pain. And suppose we add that, wherever we may find the plant man\nflourishing, in this sense, we should there suspect the existence of truth?\u2014I\nIf we say this with Nietzsche, any sort of assumption or arbitrary valuation\nwhich aims at a reverse order of things, becomes a dangerous lie in a super-\nmoral and purely physiological sense.\n\nWith these preparatory remarks we are now prepared to read [aphorism\n56](1418498124915300953_52263-h-5.htm.html#Page_215) with a complete\nunderstanding of what Nietzsche means, and to recognise in this particular\naphorism the key to the whole of Nietzsche\u2019s attitude towards Christianity.

It\nis at once a solution of our problem, and a justification of its author\u2019s\nposition. Naturally, it still remains open to Nietzsche\u2019s opponents to argue,\nif they choose, that man has flourished best under the sway of nihilistic\nreligions\u2014religions which deny life,\u2014and that consequently the falsehoods of\nChristianity are not only warrantable but also in the highest degree blessed;\nbut, in any case, the aphorism in question completely exonerates Nietzsche\nfrom a charge of inconsistency in the use of the terms \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cfalsehood\u201d\nthroughout his works, and it moreover settles once and for all the exact\naltitude from which our author looked down upon the religions of the world,\nnot only to criticise them, but also to _place_ them in the order of their\nmerit as disciplinary systems aiming at the cultivation of particular types of\nmen.\n\nNietzsche says in [aphorism\n56](1418498124915300953_52263-h-5.htm.html#Page_215):\u2014\u201cAfter all, the question\nis, to what end are falsehoods perpetrated? The fact that, in Christianity,\n\u2018holy\u2019 ends are entirely absent, constitutes _my_ objection to the means it\nemploys. Its ends are only _bad_ ends: the poisoning, the calumniation and the\ndenial of life, the contempt of the body, the degradation and self-pollution\nof man by virtue of the concept sin,\u2014consequently its means are bad as well.\u201d\n\nThus, to repeat it once more, it is not because Christianity availed itself of\nall kinds of lies that Nietzsche condemns it; for the Book of Manu\u2014which he\nadmires\u2014is just as full of falsehood as the Semitic Book of Laws; but, in the\nBook of Manu the lies are calculated to preserve and to create a strong and\nnoble type of man, whereas in Christianity the opposite type was the aim,\u2014an\naim which has been achieved in a manner far exceeding even the expectations of\nthe faithful.\n\nThis then is the main argument of the book and its conclusion; but, in the\ncourse of the general elaboration of this argument, many important side-issues\nare touched upon and developed, wherein Nietzsche reveals himself as something\nvery much more valuable than a mere iconoclast. Of course, on every page of\nhis philosophy,\u2014whatever his enemies may maintain to the contrary,\u2014he never\nonce ceases to construct, since he is incessantly enumerating and emphasising\nthose qualities and types which he fain would rear, as against those he fain\nwould see destroyed; but it is in [aphorism\n57](1418498124915300953_52263-h-5.htm.html#Page_216) of this book that\nNietzsche makes the plainest and most complete statement of his actual taste\nin Sociology, and it is upon this aphorism that all his followers and\ndisciples will ultimately have to build, if Nietzscheism is ever to become\nsomething more than a merely intellectual movement.\n\nANTHONY M.

This end justifies every\nmeans, every event on the road to it is a windfall. Above all _war._ War has\nalways been the great policy of all spirits who have penetrated too far into\nthemselves or who have grown too deep; a wound stimulates the recuperative\npowers. For many years, a maxim, the origin of which I withhold from learned\ncuriosity, has been my motto:\n\n_increscunt animi, virescit volnere virtus._  \n\nAt other times another means of recovery which is even more to my taste, is to\ncross-examine idols. There are more idols than realities in the world: this\nconstitutes my \u201cevil eye\u201d for this world: it is also my \u201cevil ear.\u201d To put\nquestions in this quarter with a hammer, and to hear perchance that well-known\nhollow sound which tells of blown-out frogs,\u2014what a joy this is for one who\nhas ears even behind his ears, for an old psychologist and Pied Piper like\nmyself in whose presence precisely that which would fain be silent, _must\nbetray itself._\n\nEven this treatise\u2014as its title shows\u2014is above all a recreation, a ray of\nsunshine, a leap sideways of a psychologist in his leisure moments. Maybe,\ntoo, a new war? And are we again cross-examining new idols? This little work\nis a great declaration of war; and with regard to the cross-examining of\nidols, this time it is not the idols of the age but eternal idols which are\nhere struck with a hammer as with a tuning fork,\u2014there are certainly no idols\nwhich are older, more convinced, and more inflated. Neither are there any more\nhollow. This does not alter the fact that they are believed in more than any\nothers, besides they are never called idols,\u2014at least, not the most exalted\namong their number.\n\nFRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE.\n\nTURIN, the 30th _September_ 1888.\n\non the day when the first  \nbook of the Transvaluation  \nof all Values was finished.\n\n* * *\n\n#### MAXIMS AND MISSILES\n\n1\n\nIdleness is the parent of all psychology.

Even Socrates\u2019 dying words were:\u2014\u201cTo live\u2014means to be ill a\nlong while: I owe a cock to the god \u00c6sculapius.\u201d Even Socrates had had enough\nof it. What does that prove? What does it point to? Formerly people would have\nsaid (\u2014oh, it has been said, and loudly enough too; by our Pessimists loudest\nof all!): \u201cIn any case there must be some truth in this! The _consensus\nsapientium_ is a proof of truth.\u201d\u2014Shall we say the same to-day? _May_ we do\nso? \u201cIn any case there must be some sickness here,\u201d we make reply. These great\nsages of all periods should first be examined more closely! Is it possible\nthat they were, everyone of them, a little shaky on their legs, effete, rocky,\ndecadent? Does wisdom perhaps appear on earth after the manner of a crow\nattracted by a slight smell of carrion?\n\n2\n\nThis irreverent belief that the great sages were decadent types, first\noccurred to me precisely in regard to that case concerning which both learned\nand vulgar prejudice was most opposed to my view. I recognised Socrates and\nPlato as symptoms of decline, as instruments in the disintegration of Hellas,\nas pseudo-Greek, as anti-Greek (\u201cThe Birth of Tragedy,\u201d 1872). That _consensus\nsapientium,_ as I perceived ever more and more clearly, did not in the least\nprove that they were right in the matter on which they agreed. It proved\nrather that these sages themselves must have been alike in some physiological\nparticular, in order to assume the same negative attitude towards life\u2014in\norder to be bound to assume that attitude. After all, judgments and valuations\nof life, whether for or against, cannot be true: their only value lies in the\nfact that they are symptoms; they can be considered only as symptoms,\u2014 _per\nse_ such judgments are nonsense. You must therefore endeavour by all means to\nreach out and try to grasp this astonishingly subtle axiom, _that the value of\nlife cannot be estimated._ A living man cannot do so, because he is a\ncontending party, or rather the very object in the dispute, and not a judge;\nnor can a dead man estimate it\u2014for other reasons. For a philosopher to see a\nproblem in the value of life, is almost an objection against him, a note of\ninterrogation set against his wisdom\u2014a lack of wisdom. What? Is it possible\nthat all these great sages were not only decadents, but that they were not\neven wise? Let me however return to the problem of Socrates.\n\n3\n\nTo judge from his origin, Socrates belonged to the lowest of the low: Socrates\nwas mob.

I try to understand the idiosyncrasy\nfrom which the Socratic equation:\u2014Reason = Virtue = Happiness, could have\narisen: the weirdest equation ever seen, and one which was essentially opposed\nto all the instincts of the older Hellenes.\n\n5\n\nWith Socrates Greek taste veers round in favour of dialectics: what actually\noccurs? In the first place a noble taste is vanquished: with dialectics the\nmob comes to the top. Before Socrates\u2019 time, dialectical manners were avoided\nin good society: they were regarded as bad manners, they were compromising.\nYoung men were cautioned against them. All such proffering of one\u2019s reasons\nwas looked upon with suspicion. Honest things like honest men do not carry\ntheir reasons on their sleeve in such fashion. It is not good form to make a\nshow of everything. That which needs to be proved cannot be worth much.\nWherever authority still belongs to good usage, wherever men do not prove but\ncommand, the dialectician is regarded as a sort of clown. People laugh at him,\nthey do not take him seriously. Socrates was a clown who succeeded in making\nmen take him seriously: what then was the matter?\n\n6\n\nA man resorts to dialectics only when he has no other means to hand. People\nknow that they excite suspicion with it and that it is not very convincing.\nNothing is more easily dispelled than a dialectical effect: this is proved by\nthe experience of every gathering in which discussions are held. It can be\nonly the last defence of those who have no other weapons. One must require to\nextort one\u2019s right, otherwise one makes no use of it. That is why the Jews\nwere dialecticians. Reynard the Fox was a dialectician: what?\u2014and was Socrates\none as well?\n\n7\n\nIs the Socratic irony an expression of revolt, of mob resentment? Does\nSocrates, as a creature suffering under oppression, enjoy his innate ferocity\nin the knife-thrusts of the syllogism? Does he wreak his revenge on the\nnoblemen he fascinates?\u2014As a dialectician a man has a merciless instrument to\nwield; he can play the tyrant with it: he compromises when he conquers with\nit. The dialectician leaves it to his opponent to prove that he is no idiot:\nhe infuriates, he likewise paralyses. The dialectician cripples the intellect\nof his opponent.

He fascinated by appealing to the combative\ninstinct of the Greeks,\u2014he introduced a variation into the contests between\nmen and youths. Socrates was also a great erotic.\n\n9\n\nBut Socrates divined still more. He saw right through his noble Athenians; he\nperceived that his case, his peculiar case, was no exception even in his time.\nThe same kind of degeneracy was silently preparing itself everywhere: ancient\nAthens was dying out. And Socrates understood that the whole world needed\nhim,\u2014his means, his remedy, his special artifice for self-preservation.\nEverywhere the instincts were in a state of anarchy; everywhere people were\nwithin an ace of excess: the _monstrum in animo_ was the general danger. \u201cThe\ninstincts would play the tyrant; we must discover a counter-tyrant who is\nstronger than they.\u201d On the occasion when that physiognomist had unmasked\nSocrates, and had told him what he was, a crater full of evil desires, the\ngreat Master of Irony let fall one or two words more, which provide the key to\nhis nature. \u201cThis is true,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I overcame them all.\u201d How did\nSocrates succeed in mastering himself? His case was at bottom only the extreme\nand most apparent example of a state of distress which was beginning to be\ngeneral: that state in which no one was able to master himself and in which\nthe instincts turned one against the other. As the extreme example of this\nstate, he fascinated\u2014his terrifying ugliness made him conspicuous to every\neye: it is quite obvious that he fascinated still more as a reply, as a\nsolution, as an apparent cure of this case.\n\n10\n\nWhen a man finds it necessary, as Socrates did, to create a tyrant out of\nreason, there is no small danger that something else wishes to play the\ntyrant. Reason was then discovered as a saviour; neither Socrates nor his\n\u201cpatients\u201d were at liberty to be rational or not, as they pleased; at that\ntime it was _de rigueur,_ it had become a last shift. The fanaticism with\nwhich the whole of Greek thought plunges into reason, betrays a critical\ncondition of things: men were in danger; there were only two alternatives:\neither perish or else be absurdly rational. The moral bias of Greek philosophy\nfrom Plato onward, is the outcome of a pathological condition, as is also its\nappreciation of dialectics. Reason = Virtue = Happiness, simply means: we must\nimitate Socrates, and confront the dark passions permanently with the light of\nday\u2014the light of reason. We must at all costs be clever, precise, clear: all\nyielding to the instincts, to the unconscious, leads downwards.\n\n11\n\nI have now explained how Socrates fascinated: he seemed to be a doctor, a\nSaviour. Is it necessary to expose the errors which lay in his faith in\n\u201creason at any price\u201d?\u2014It is a piece of self-deception on the part of\nphilosophers and moralists to suppose that they can extricate themselves from\ndegeneration by merely waging war upon it.

For instance their\nlack of the historical sense, their hatred even of the idea of Becoming, their\nEgyptianism. They imagine that they do honour to a thing by divorcing it from\nhistory _sub specie \u00e6terni,\u2014_ when they make a mummy of it. All the ideas that\nphilosophers have treated for thousands of years, have been mummied concepts;\nnothing real has ever come out of their hands alive. These idolaters of\nconcepts merely kill and stuff things when they worship,\u2014they threaten the\nlife of everything they adore. Death, change, age, as well as procreation and\ngrowth, are in their opinion objections,\u2014even refutations. That which is\ncannot evolve; that which evolves _is_ not. Now all of them believe, and even\nwith desperation, in Being. But, as they cannot lay hold of it, they try to\ndiscover reasons why this privilege is withheld from them. \u201cSome merely\napparent quality, some deception must be the cause of our not being able to\nascertain the nature of Being: where is the deceiver?\u201d \u201cWe have him,\u201d they cry\nrejoicing, \u201cit is sensuality!\u201d These senses, _which in other things are so\nimmoral,_ cheat us concerning the true world. Moral: we must get rid of the\ndeception of the senses, of Becoming, of history, of falsehood.\u2014History is\nnothing more than the belief in the senses, the belief in falsehood. Moral: we\nmust say \u201cno\u201d to everything in which the senses believe: to all the rest of\nmankind: all that belongs to the \u201cpeople.\u201d Let us be philosophers, mummies,\nmonotono-theists, grave-diggers!\u2014And above all, away with the _body,_ this\nwretched _id\u00e9e fixe_ of the senses, infected with all the faults of logic that\nexist, refuted, even impossible, although it be impudent enough to pose as if\nit were real!\n\n2\n\nWith a feeling of great reverence I except the name of _Heraclitus._ If the\nrest of the philosophic gang rejected the evidences of the senses, because the\nlatter revealed a state of multifariousness and change, he rejected the same\nevidence because it revealed things as if they possessed permanence and unity.\nEven Heraclitus did an injustice to the senses.

In all these things\nreality does not come into consideration at all, even as a problem; just as\nlittle as does the question concerning the general value of such a convention\nof symbols as logic.\n\n4\n\nThe other idiosyncrasy of philosophers is no less dangerous; it consists in\nconfusing the last and the first things. They place that which makes its\nappearance last\u2014unfortunately! for it ought not to appear at all!\u2014the \u201chighest\nconcept,\u201d that is to say, the most general, the emptiest, the last cloudy\nstreak of evaporating reality, at the beginning as the beginning. This again\nis only their manner of expressing their veneration: the highest thing must\nnot have grown out of the lowest, it must not have grown at all.... Moral:\neverything of the first rank must be _causa sui._ To have been derived from\nsomething else, is as good as an objection, it sets the value of a thing in\nquestion. All superior values are of the first rank, all the highest\nconcepts\u2014that of Being, of the Absolute, of Goodness, of Truth, and of\nPerfection; all these things cannot have been evolved, they must therefore be\n_causa sui._ All these things cannot however be unlike one another, they\ncannot be opposed to one another. Thus they attain to their stupendous concept\n\u201cGod.\u201d The last, most attenuated and emptiest thing is postulated as the first\nthing, as the absolute cause, as _ens realissimum._ Fancy humanity having to\ntake the brain diseases of morbid cobweb-spinners seriously!\u2014And it has paid\ndearly for having done so.\n\n5\n\n\u2014Against this let us set the different manner in which we (\u2014you observe that I\nam courteous enough to say \u201cwe\u201d) conceive the problem of the error and\ndeceptiveness of things. Formerly people regarded change and evolution in\ngeneral as the proof of appearance, as a sign of the fact that something must\nbe there that leads us astray. To-day, on the other hand, we realise that\nprecisely as far as the rational bias forces us to postulate unity, identity,\npermanence, substance, cause, materiality and being, we are in a measure\ninvolved in error, driven necessarily to error; however certain we may feel,\nas the result of a strict examination of the matter, that the error lies here.\nIt is just the same here as with the motion of the sun: In its case it was our\neyes that were wrong; in the matter of the concepts above mentioned it is our\nlanguage itself that pleads most constantly in their favour.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 38821, "end_char_idx": 42989, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f22e779d-ba5e-49dd-9f69-676896c4f722": {"__data__": {"id_": "f22e779d-ba5e-49dd-9f69-676896c4f722", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "52ce8356-28ca-4fd0-8eb5-1ff3aabc8a3b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ccacc582c0a976ac41dcb5ef4cb24995eba34bf63d001bc0cdd72802091e1e89", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "826de829-8f03-48fc-b087-0b3d171645b1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "d162924ff64e7b97fc2ae90c1da0b9d8deb0e2d0efe5d09721c649da8675bfdd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "33619bc2-dfb1-4a39-a8f9-20254d8e7107", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d9a1c7f77bcdb06de0331b3c86462e4961330b624c6ae28e6ef585ea8fa38656", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Formerly people regarded change and evolution in\ngeneral as the proof of appearance, as a sign of the fact that something must\nbe there that leads us astray.

Did Nietzsche know that Kant was\nsimply a Scotch Puritan, whose family had settled in Germany?\n\n* * *\n\n#### MORALITY AS THE ENEMY OF NATURE\n\n1\n\nThere is a time when all passions are simply fatal in their action, when they\nwreck their victims with the weight of their folly,\u2014and there is a later\nperiod, a very much later period, when they marry with the spirit, when they\n\u201cspiritualise\u201d themselves. Formerly, owing to the stupidity inherent in\npassion, men waged war against passion itself: men pledged themselves to\nannihilate it,\u2014all ancient moral-mongers were unanimous on this point, \u201c _il\nfaut tuer les passions._ \u201d The most famous formula for this stands in the New\nTestament, in that Sermon on the Mount, where, let it be said incidentally,\nthings are by no means regarded _from a height._ It is said there, for\ninstance, with an application to sexuality: \u201cif thy eye offend thee, pluck it\nout\u201d: fortunately no Christian acts in obedience to this precept. To\nannihilate the passions and desires, simply on account of their stupidity, and\nto obviate the unpleasant consequences of their stupidity, seems to us to-day\nmerely an aggravated form of stupidity. We no longer admire those dentists who\nextract teeth simply in order that they may not ache again. On the other hand,\nit will be admitted with some reason, that on the soil from which Christianity\ngrew, the idea of the \u201cspiritualisation of passion\u201d could not possibly have\nbeen conceived. The early Church, as everyone knows, certainly did wage war\nagainst the \u201cintelligent,\u201d in favour of the \u201cpoor in spirit\u201d In these\ncircumstances how could the passions be combated intelligently? The Church\ncombats passion by means of excision of all kinds: its practice, its \u201cremedy,\u201d\nis _castration._ It never inquires \u201chow can a desire be spiritualised,\nbeautified, deified?\u201d\u2014In all ages it has laid the weight of discipline in the\nprocess of extirpation (the extirpation of sensuality, pride, lust of\ndominion, lust of property, and revenge).\u2014But to attack the passions at their\nroots, means attacking life itself at its source: the method of the Church is\nhostile to life.\n\n2\n\nThe same means, castration and extirpation, are instinctively chosen for\nwaging war against a passion, by those who are too weak of will, too\ndegenerate, to impose some sort of moderation upon it; by those natures who,\nto speak in metaphor (\u2014and without metaphor), need _la Trappe,_ or some kind\nof ultimatum of war, a _gulf_ set between themselves and a passion. Only\ndegenerates find radical methods indispensable: weakness of will, or more\nstrictly speaking, the inability not to react to a stimulus, is in itself\nsimply another form of degeneracy. Radical and mortal hostility to sensuality,\nremains a suspicious symptom: it justifies one in being suspicious of the\ngeneral state of one who goes to such extremes.

Another triumph is our spiritualisation of hostility. It\nconsists in the fact that we are beginning to realise very profoundly the\nvalue of having enemies: in short that with them we are forced to do and to\nconclude precisely the reverse of what we previously did and concluded. In all\nages the Church wished to annihilate its enemies: we, the immoralists and\nAntichrists, see our advantage in the survival of the Church. Even in\npolitical life, hostility has now become more spiritual,\u2014much more cautious,\nmuch more thoughtful, and much more moderate. Almost every party sees its\nself-preservative interests in preventing the Opposition from going to pieces;\nand the same applies to politics on a grand scale. A new creation, more\nparticularly, like the new Empire, has more need of enemies than friends: only\nas a contrast does it begin to feel necessary, only as a contrast does it\n_become_ necessary. And we behave in precisely the same way to the \u201cinner\nenemy\u201d: in this quarter too we have spiritualised enmity, in this quarter too\nwe have understood its value. A man is productive only in so far as he is rich\nin contrasted instincts; he can remain young only on condition that his soul\ndoes not begin to take things easy and to yearn for peace. Nothing has grown\nmore alien to us than that old desire\u2014the \u201cpeace of the soul,\u201d which is the\naim of Christianity. Nothing could make us less envious than the moral cow and\nthe plump happiness of a clean conscience. The man who has renounced war has\nrenounced a grand life. In many cases, of course, \u201cpeace of the soul\u201d is\nmerely a misunderstanding,\u2014it is something _very different_ which has failed\nto find a more honest name for itself. Without either circumlocution or\nprejudice I will suggest a few cases. \u201cPeace of the soul\u201d may for instance be\nthe sweet effulgence of rich animality in the realm of morality (or religion).\nOr the first presage of weariness, the first shadow that evening, every kind\nof evening, is wont to cast. Or a sign that the air is moist, and that winds\nare blowing up from the south. Or unconscious gratitude for a good digestion\n(sometimes called \u201cbrotherly love\u201d). Or the serenity of the convalescent, on\nwhose lips all things have a new taste, and who bides his time. Or the\ncondition which follows upon a thorough gratification of our strongest\npassion, the well-being of unaccustomed satiety. Or the senility of our will,\nof our desires, and of our vices. Or laziness, coaxed by vanity into togging\nitself out in a moral garb. Or the ending of a state of long suspense and of\nagonising uncertainty, by a state of certainty, of even terrible certainty. Or\nthe expression of ripeness and mastery in the midst of a task, of a creative\nwork, of a production, of a thing willed, the calm breathing that denotes that\n\u201cfreedom of will\u201d has been attained.

Inasmuch as it says\n\u201cGod sees into the heart of man,\u201d it says Nay to the profoundest and most\nsuperior desires of life and takes God as the enemy of life.

For the\ncondemnation of life by a living creature is after all but the symptom of a\ndefinite kind of life: the question as to whether the condemnation is\njustified or the reverse is not even raised. In order even to approach the\nproblem of the value of life, a man would need to be placed outside life, and\nmoreover know it as well as one, as many, as all in fact, who have lived it\nThese are reasons enough to prove to us that this problem is an inaccessible\none to us. When we speak of values, we speak under the inspiration, and\nthrough the optics of life: life itself urges us to determine values: life\nitself values through us when we determine values. From which it follows that\neven that morality which is antagonistic to life, and which conceives God as\nthe opposite and the condemnation of life, is only a valuation of life\u2014of what\nlife? of what kind of life? But I have already answered this question: it is\nthe valuation of declining, of enfeebled, of exhausted and of condemned life.\nMorality, as it has been understood hitherto\u2014as it was finally formulated by\nSchopenhauer in the words \u201cThe Denial of the Will to Life,\u201d is the instinct of\ndegeneration itself, which converts itself into an imperative: it says:\n\u201cPerish!\u201d It is the death sentence of men who are already doomed.\n\n6\n\nLet us at last consider how exceedingly simple it is on our part to say: \u201cMan\nshould be thus and thus!\u201d Reality shows us a marvellous wealth of types, and a\nluxuriant variety of forms and changes: and yet the first wretch of a moral\nloafer that comes along cries \u201cNo! Man should be different!\u201d He even knows\nwhat man should be like, does this sanctimonious prig: he draws his own face\non the wall and declares: \u201c _ecce homo!_ \u201d But even when the moralist\naddresses himself only to the individual and says \u201cthus and thus shouldst thou\nbe!\u201d he still makes an ass of himself. The individual in his past and future\nis a piece of fate, one law the more, one necessity the more for all that is\nto come and is to be. To say to him \u201cchange thyself,\u201d is tantamount to saying\nthat everything should change, even backwards as well.

Nevertheless this error is one of the most\nancient and most recent habits of mankind. In one part of the world it has\neven been canonised; and it bears the name of \u201cReligion\u201d and \u201cMorality.\u201d Every\npostulate formulated by religion and morality contains it. Priests and the\npromulgators of moral laws are the promoters of this perversion of reason.\u2014Let\nme give you an example. Everybody knows the book of the famous Cornaro, in\nwhich he recommends his slender diet as the recipe for a long, happy and also\nvirtuous life. Few books have been so widely read, and to this day many\nthousand copies of it are still printed annually in England. I do not doubt\nthat there is scarcely a single book (the Bible of course excepted) that has\nworked more mischief, shortened more lives, than this well-meant curiosity.\nThe reason of this is the confusion of effect and cause. This worthy Italian\nsaw the cause of his long life in his diet: whereas the prerequisites of long\nlife, which are exceptional slowness of molecular change, and a low rate of\nexpenditure in energy, were the cause of his meagre diet He was not at liberty\nto eat a small or a great amount. His frugality was not the result of free\nchoice, he would have been ill had he eaten more. He who does not happen to be\na carp, however, is not only wise to eat well, but is also compelled to do so.\nA scholar of the present day, with his rapid consumption of nervous energy,\nwould soon go to the dogs on Cornaro\u2019s diet. _Crede experto._ \u2014\n\n2\n\nThe most general principle lying at the root of every religion and morality,\nis this: \u201cDo this and that and avoid this and that\u2014and thou wilt be happy.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 58437, "end_char_idx": 61948, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bd844719-6e1e-435a-b72f-e8909bf875ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "bd844719-6e1e-435a-b72f-e8909bf875ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "52ce8356-28ca-4fd0-8eb5-1ff3aabc8a3b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ccacc582c0a976ac41dcb5ef4cb24995eba34bf63d001bc0cdd72802091e1e89", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d17e38dc-c95d-475c-8c54-160645840c95", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "c9f84aa5d310712e34e58ce6b6fe463320355a949f195633d82f9f1cb9e5d493", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "566e0629-e5c4-4f6f-b488-8a4f80723f09", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f4c8d0399a9ec9023abed9778c9803a94802ffec0ab03197cddc5165958ce3f2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "This worthy Italian\nsaw the cause of his long life in his diet: whereas the prerequisites of long\nlife, which are exceptional slowness of molecular change, and a low rate of\nexpenditure in energy, were the cause of his meagre diet He was not at liberty\nto eat a small or a great amount.

Such and such a young man grows pale and withered\nprematurely. His friends say this or that illness is the cause of it I say:\nthe fact that he became ill, the fact that he did not resist illness, was in\nitself already the outcome of impoverished life, of hereditary exhaustion. The\nnewspaper reader says: such and such a party by committing such an error will\nmeet its death. My superior politics say: a party that can make such mistakes,\nis in its last agony\u2014it no longer possesses any certainty of instinct. Every\nmistake is in every sense the sequel to degeneration of the instincts, to\ndisintegration of the will. This is almost the definition of evil, Everything\nvaluable is instinct\u2014and consequently easy, necessary, free. Exertion is an\nobjection, the god is characteristically different from the hero (in my\nlanguage: light feet are the first attribute of divinity).\n\n3\n\n_The error of false causality._ In all ages men have believed that they knew\nwhat a cause was: but whence did we derive this knowledge, or more accurately,\nthis faith in the fact that we know? Out of the realm of the famous \u201cinner\nfacts of consciousness,\u201d not one of which has yet proved itself to be a fact\nWe believed ourselves to be causes even in the action of the will; we thought\nthat in this matter at least we caught causality red-handed. No one doubted\nthat all the _antecedentia_ of an action were to be sought in consciousness,\nand could be discovered there\u2014as \u201cmotive\u201d\u2014if only they were sought. Otherwise\nwe should not be free to perform them, we should not have been responsible for\nthem. Finally who would have questioned that a thought is caused? that the ego\ncauses the thought? Of these three \u201cfacts of inner consciousness\u201d by means of\nwhich causality seemed to be guaranteed, the first and most convincing is that\nof the will as cause; the conception of consciousness (\u201cspirit\u201d) as a cause,\nand subsequently that of the ego (the \u201csubject\u201d) as a cause, were merely born\nafterwards, once the causality of the will stood established as \u201cgiven,\u201d as a\nfact of experience. Meanwhile we have come to our senses. To-day we no longer\nbelieve a word of all this.

There are no such things as spiritual\ncauses. The whole of popular experience on this subject went to the devil!\nThat is the result of it all. For we had blissfully abused that experience, we\nhad built the world upon it as a world of causes, as a world of will, as a\nworld of spirit. The most antiquated and most traditional psychology has been\nat work here, it has done nothing else: all phenomena were deeds in the light\nof this psychology, and all deeds were the result of will; according to it the\nworld was a complex mechanism of agents, an agent (a \u201csubject\u201d) lay at the\nroot of all things. Man projected his three \u201cinner facts of consciousness,\u201d\nthe will, the spirit, and the ego in which he believed most firmly, outside\nhimself.

Was it to be wondered at that later on he always found in things\nonly that which he had laid in them?\u2014The thing itself, I repeat, the concept\nthing was merely a reflex of the belief in the ego as cause.

The cannon shot presents itself in a _causal_ manner, by means of an\napparent reversal in the order of time. That which occurs last, the\nmotivation, is experienced first, often with a hundred details which flash\npast like lightning, and the shot is the _result._ What has happened?

We are never satisfied by\nmerely ascertaining the fact that we feel thus or thus: we admit this fact\u2014we\nbecome conscious of it\u2014only when we have attributed it to some kind of\nmotivation.

And in this way we\nbecome _accustomed_ to a particular interpretation of causes which, truth to\ntell, actually hinders and even utterly prevents the investigation of the\nproper cause.\n\n5\n\n_The Psychological Explanation of the above Fact._ To trace something\nunfamiliar back to something familiar, is at once a relief, a comfort and a\nsatisfaction, while it also produces a feeling of power. The unfamiliar\ninvolves danger, anxiety and care,\u2014the fundamental instinct is to get rid of\nthese painful circumstances. First principle: any explanation is better than\nnone at all. Since, at bottom, it is only a question of shaking one\u2019s self\nfree from certain oppressive ideas, the means employed to this end are not\nselected with overmuch punctiliousness: the first idea by means of which the\nunfamiliar is revealed as familiar, produces a feeling of such comfort that it\nis \u201cheld to be true.\u201d The proof of happiness (\u201cof power\u201d) as the criterion of\ntruth. The instinct of causality is therefore conditioned and stimulated by\nthe feeling of fear. Whenever possible, the question \u201cwhy?\u201d should not only\neduce the cause as cause, but rather a certain kind of cause\u2014a comforting,\nliberating and reassuring cause. The first result of this need is that\nsomething known or already experienced, and recorded in the memory, is posited\nas the cause. The new factor, that which has not been experienced and which is\nunfamiliar, is excluded from the sphere of causes. Not only do we try to find\na certain kind of explanation as the cause, but those kinds of explanations\nare selected and preferred which dissipate most rapidly the sensation of\nstrangeness, novelty and unfamiliarity,\u2014in fact the most ordinary\nexplanations. And the result is that a certain manner of postulating causes\ntends to predominate ever more and more, becomes concentrated into a system,\nand finally reigns supreme, to the complete exclusion of all other causes and\nexplanations.

These sensations depend upon punishment, upon compensation for\nsomething which we ought not to have done, which we ought not to have been\n(this idea was generalised in a more impudent form by Schopenhauer, into that\nprinciple in which morality appears in its real colours,\u2014that is to say, as a\nveritable poisoner and slanderer of life: \u201call great suffering, whether mental\nor physical, reveals what we deserve: for it could not visit us if we did not\ndeserve it,\u201d \u201cThe World as Will and Idea,\u201d vol. 2, p. 666). These sensations\nare the outcome of ill-considered actions, having evil consequences, (\u2014the\npassions, the senses, postulated as causes, as guilty. By means of other\ncalamities distressing physiological conditions are interpreted as\n\u201cmerited\u201d).\u2014The \u201cexplanation\u201d of pleasant sensations. These sensations are\ndependent upon a trust in God. They may depend upon our consciousness of\nhaving done one or two good actions (a so-called \u201cgood conscience\u201d is a\nphysiological condition, which may be the outcome of good digestion). They may\ndepend upon the happy issue of certain undertakings (\u2014an ingenuous mistake:\nthe happy issue of an undertaking certainly does not give a hypochondriac or a\nPascal any general sensation of pleasure). They may depend upon faith, love\nand hope,\u2014the Christian virtues. As a matter of fact all these pretended\nexplanations are but the results of certain states, and as it were\ntranslations of feelings of pleasure and pain into a false dialect: a man is\nin a condition of hopefulness because the dominant physiological sensation of\nhis being is again one of strength and wealth; he trusts in God because the\nfeeling of abundance and power gives him a peaceful state of mind. Morality\nand religion are completely and utterly parts of the psychology of error: in\nevery particular case cause and effect are confounded; as truth is confounded\nwith the effect of that which is believed to be true; or a certain state of\nconsciousness is confounded with the chain of causes which brought it about.\n\n7\n\n_The Error of Free-Will._ At present we no longer have any mercy upon the\nconcept \u201cfree-will\u201d: we know only too well what it is\u2014the most egregious\ntheological trick that has ever existed for the purpose of making mankind\n\u201cresponsible\u201d in a theological manner,\u2014that is to say, to make mankind\ndependent upon theologians. I will now explain to you only the psychology of\nthe whole process of inculcating the sense of responsibility. Wherever men try\nto trace responsibility home to anyone, it is the instinct of punishment and\nof the desire to judge which is active. Becoming is robbed of its innocence\nwhen any particular condition of things is traced to a will, to intentions and\nto responsible actions.

Morality is merely a sign-language, simply\nsymptomatology: one must already know what it is all about in order to turn it\nto any use.\n\n2\n\nLet me give you one example, quite provisionally. In all ages there have been\npeople who wished to \u201cimprove\u201d mankind: this above all is what was called\nmorality. But the most different tendencies are concealed beneath the same\nword. Both the taming of the beast man, and the rearing of a particular type\nof man, have been called \u201cimprovement\u201d: these zoological _termini,_ alone,\nrepresent real things\u2014real things of which the typical \u201cimprover,\u201d the priest,\nnaturally knows nothing, and will know nothing. To call the taming of an\nanimal \u201cimproving\u201d it, sounds to our ears almost like a joke. He who knows\nwhat goes on in menageries, doubts very much whether an animal is improved in\nsuch places. It is certainly weakened, it is made less dangerous, and by means\nof the depressing influence of fear, pain, wounds, and hunger, it is converted\ninto a sick animal. And the same holds good of the tamed man whom the priest\nhas \u201cimproved.\u201d In the early years of the Middle Ages, during which the Church\nwas most distinctly and above all a menagerie, the most beautiful examples of\nthe \u201cblond beast\u201d were hunted down in all directions,\u2014the noble Germans, for\ninstance, were \u201cimproved.\u201d But what did this \u201cimproved\u201d German, who had been\nlured to the monastery look like after the process? He looked like a\ncaricature of man, like an abortion: he had become a \u201csinner,\u201d he was caged\nup, he had been imprisoned behind a host of apparling notions. He now lay\nthere, sick, wretched, malevolent even toward himself: full of hate for the\ninstincts of life, full of suspicion in regard to all that is still strong and\nhappy. In short a \u201cChristian.\u201d In physiological terms: in a fight with an\nanimal, the only way of making it weak may be to make it sick. The Church\nundersood this: it ruined man, it made him weak,\u2014but it laid claim to having\n\u201cimproved\u201d him.\n\n3\n\nNow let us consider the other case which is called morality, the case of the\nrearing of a particular race and species. The most magnificent example of this\nis offered by Indian morality, and is sanctioned religiously as the \u201cLaw of\nManu.\u201d In this book the task is set of rearing no less than four races at\nonce: a priestly race, a warrior race, a merchant and agricultural race, and\nfinally a race of servants\u2014the Sudras. It is quite obvious that we are no\nlonger in a circus watching tamers of wild animals in this book. To have\nconceived even the plan of such a breeding scheme, presupposes the existence\nof a man who is a hundred times milder and more reasonable than the mere lion-\ntamer. One breathes more freely, after stepping out of the Christian\natmosphere of hospitals and prisons, into this more salubrious, loftier and\nmore spacious world. What a wretched thing the New Testament is beside Manu,\nwhat an evil odour hangs around it!\u2014But even this organisation found it\nnecessary to be terrible,\u2014not this time in a struggle with the animal-man, but\nwith his opposite, the non-caste man, the hotch-potch man, the Chandala. And\nonce again it had no other means of making him weak and harmless, than by\nmaking him sick,\u2014it was the struggle with the greatest \u201cnumber.\u201d Nothing\nperhaps is more offensive to our feelings than these measures of security on\nthe part of Indian morality.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 77913, "end_char_idx": 81976, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "021f7fa3-dc51-4713-a41a-5e355dc2a413": {"__data__": {"id_": "021f7fa3-dc51-4713-a41a-5e355dc2a413", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "52ce8356-28ca-4fd0-8eb5-1ff3aabc8a3b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ccacc582c0a976ac41dcb5ef4cb24995eba34bf63d001bc0cdd72802091e1e89", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a2777e1a-9931-4c16-a1b5-abc22750b885", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "94967580b5242425958735cfb60cc788076edc44530ad45f548cf65d217b8950", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b8d930a7-6454-47d4-994b-a150fc89d282", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0ca9c70f913262c01a63819ca6f22a3c23803543d8a73ff5ee06b24f718f20cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "One breathes more freely, after stepping out of the Christian\natmosphere of hospitals and prisons, into this more salubrious, loftier and\nmore spacious world.

The third edict, for instance (Avadana-Sastra\nI.), which treats \u201cof impure vegetables,\u201d ordains that the only nourishment\nthat the Chandala should be allowed must consist of garlic and onions, as the\nholy scriptures forbid their being given corn or grain-bearing fruit, water\nand fire. The same edict declares that the water which they need must be drawn\nneither out of rivers, wells or ponds, but only out of the ditches leading to\nswamps and out of the holes left by the footprints of animals. They are\nlikewise forbidden to wash either their linen or themselves since the water\nwhich is graciously granted to them must only be used for quenching their\nthirst. Finally Sudra women are forbidden to assist Chandala women at their\nconfinements, while Chandala women are also forbidden to assist each other at\nsuch times. The results of sanitary regulations of this kind could not fail to\nmake themselves felt; deadly epidemics and the most ghastly venereal diseases\nsoon appeared, and in consequence of these again \u201cthe Law of the Knife,\u201d\u2014that\nis to say circumcision, was prescribed for male children and the removal of\nthe small labia from the females. Manu himself says: \u201cthe Chandala are the\nfruit of adultery, incest, and crime (\u2014this is the necessary consequence of\nthe idea of breeding). Their clothes shall consist only of the rags torn from\ncorpses, their vessels shall be the fragments of broken pottery, their\nornaments shall be made of old iron, and their religion shall be the worship\nof evil spirits; without rest they shall wander from place to place. They are\nforbidden to write from left to right or to use their right hand in writing:\nthe use of the right hand and writing from left to right are reserved to\npeople of virtue, to people of race.\u201d\n\n4\n\nThese regulations are instructive enough: we can see in them the absolutely\npure and primeval humanity of the Aryans,\u2014we learn that the notion \u201cpure\nblood,\u201d is the reverse of harmless. On the other hand it becomes clear among\nwhich people the hatred, the Chandala hatred of this humanity has been\nimmortalised, among which people it has become religion and genius. From this\npoint of view the gospels are documents of the highest value; and the Book of\nEnoch is still more so. Christianity as sprung from Jewish roots and\ncomprehensible only as grown upon this soil, represents the counter-movement\nagainst that morality of breeding, of race and of privilege:\u2014it is essentially\nan anti-Aryan religion: Christianity is the transvaluation of all Aryan\nvalues, the triumph of Chandala values, the proclaimed gospel of the poor and\nof the low, the general insurrection of all the down-trodden, the wretched,\nthe bungled and the botched, against the \u201crace,\u201d\u2014the immortal revenge of the\nChandala as the _religion of love._\n\n5\n\nThe morality of breeding and the morality of taming, in the means which they\nadopt in order to prevail, are quite worthy of each other: we may lay down as\na leading principle that in order to create morality a man must have the\nabsolute will to immorality.

And no\none despises his opponent.\n\nYou observe that it is my desire to be fair to the Germans: and in this\nrespect I should not like to be untrue to myself,\u2014I must therefore also state\nmy objections to them. It costs a good deal to attain to a position of power;\nfor power _stultifies._ The Germans\u2014they were once called a people of\nthinkers: do they really think at all at present? Nowadays the Germans are\nbored by intellect, they mistrust intellect; politics have swallowed up all\nearnestness for really intellectual things\u2014\u201cGermany, Germany above\nall.\u201d[[1]](1418498124915300953_52263-h-2.htm.html#Footnote_1_6) I fear this\nwas the death-blow to German philosophy. \u201cAre there any German philosophers?\nAre there any German poets? Are there any good German books?\u201d people ask me\nabroad. I blush; but with that pluck which is peculiar to me, even in moments\nof desperation, I reply: \u201cYes, Bismarck!\u201d\u2014Could I have dared to confess what\nbooks _are_ read to-day? Cursed instinct of mediocrity!\u2014\n\n2\n\nWhat might not German intellect have been!\u2014who has not thought sadly upon this\nquestion! But this nation has deliberately stultified itself for almost a\nthousand years: nowhere else have the two great European narcotics, alcohol\nand Christianity, been so viciously abused as in Germany. Recently a third\nopiate was added to the list, one which in itself alone would have sufficed to\ncomplete the ruin of all subtle and daring intellectual animation, I speak of\nmusic, our costive and constipating German music. How much peevish\nponderousness, paralysis, dampness, dressing-gown languor, and beer is there\nnot in German intelligence!\n\nHow is it really possible that young men who consecrate their whole lives to\nthe pursuit of intellectual ends, should not feel within them the first\ninstinct of intellectuality, the _self-preservative instinct of the intellect_\n\u2014and should drink beer?

I have said that it is becoming coarser and\nshallower. Is that enough?\u2014In reality something very different frightens me,\nand that is the ever steady decline of German earnestness, German profundity,\nand German passion in things intellectual. Not only intellectuality, but also\npathos has altered. From time to time I come in touch with German\nuniversities; what an extraordinary atmosphere prevails among their scholars!\nwhat barrenness! and what self-satisfied and lukewarm intellectuality! For any\none to point to German science as an argument against me would show that he\ngrossly misunderstood my meaning, while it would also prove that he had not\nread a word of my writings. For seventeen years I have done little else than\nexpose the de-intellectualising influence of our modern scientific studies.\nThe severe slavery to which every individual nowadays is condemned by the\nenormous range covered by the sciences, is the chief reason why fuller, richer\nand profounder natures can find no education or educators that are fit for\nthem. Nothing is more deleterious to this age than the superfluity of\npretentious loafers and fragmentary human beings; our universities are really\nthe involuntary forcing houses for this kind of withering-up of the instincts\nof intellectuality. And the whole of Europe is beginning to know this\u2014politics\non a large scale deceive no one. Germany is becoming ever more and more the\nFlat-land of Europe. I am still in search of a German with whom I could be\nserious after my own fashion. And how much more am I in search of one with\nwhom I could be cheerful _\u2014The Twilight of the Idols:_ ah! what man to-day\nwould be capable of understanding the kind of seriousness from which a\nphilosopher is recovering in this work! It is our cheerfulness that people\nunderstand least.\n\n4\n\nLet us examine another aspect of the question: it is not only obvious that\nGerman culture is declining, but adequate reasons for this decline are not\nlacking. After all, nobody can spend more than he has:\u2014this is true of\nindividuals, it is also true of nations. If you spend your strength in\nacquiring power, or in politics on a large scale, or in economy, or in\nuniversal commerce, or in parliamentarism, or in military interests\u2014if you\ndissipate the modicum of reason, of earnestness, of will, and of self-control\nthat constitutes your nature in one particular fashion, you cannot dissipate\nit in another.

Even at this moment a\nlarge amount of fresh intellectual earnestness and passion has emigrated to\nParis; the question of pessimism, for instance, and the question of Wagner; in\nFrance almost all psychological and artistic questions are considered with\nincomparably more subtlety and thoroughness than they are in Germany,\u2014the\nGermans are even incapable of this kind of earnestness. In the history of\nEuropean culture the rise of the Empire signifies, above all, a displacement\nof the centre of gravity. Everywhere people are already aware of this: in\nthings that really matter\u2014and these after all constitute culture,\u2014the Germans\nare no longer worth considering. I ask you, can you show me one single man of\nbrains who could be mentioned in the same breath with other European thinkers,\nlike your Goethe, your Hegel, your Heinrich Heine, and your Schopenhauer?\u2014The\nfact that there is no longer a single German philosopher worth mentioning is\nan increasing wonder.\n\n5\n\nEverything that matters has been lost sight of by the whole of the higher\neducational system of Germany: the end quite as much as the means to that end.\nPeople forget that education, the process of cultivation itself, is the\nend\u2014and not \u201cthe Empire\u201d\u2014they forget that the _educator_ is required for this\nend\u2014and not the public-school teacher and university scholar. Educators are\nneeded who are themselves educated, superior and noble intellects, who can\nprove that they are thus qualified, that they are ripe and mellow products of\nculture at every moment of their lives, in word and in gesture;\u2014not the\nlearned louts who, like \u201csuperior wet-nurses,\u201d are now thrust upon the youth\nof the land by public schools and universities. With but rare exceptions, that\nwhich is lacking in Germany is the first prerequisite of education\u2014that is to\nsay, the educators; hence the decline of German culture. One of those rarest\nexceptions is my highly respected friend Jacob Burckhardt of B\u00e2le: to him\nabove all is B\u00e2le indebted for its foremost position in human culture What the\nhigher schools of Germany really do accomplish is this, they brutally train a\nvast crowd of young men, in the smallest amount of time possible, to become\nuseful and exploitable servants of the state. \u201cHigher education\u201d and a vast\ncrowd\u2014these terms contradict each other from the start. All superior education\ncan only concern the exception: a man must be privileged in order to have a\nright to such a great privilege. All great and beautiful things cannot be a\ncommon possession: _pulchrum est paucorum hominum._ \u2014What is it that brings\nabout the decline of German culture? The fact that \u201chigher education\u201d is no\nlonger a special privilege\u2014the democracy of a process of cultivation that has\nbecome \u201cgeneral,\u201d _common._ Nor must it be forgotten that the privileges of\nthe military profession by urging many too many to attend the higher schools,\ninvolve the downfall of the latter. In modern Germany nobody is at liberty to\ngive his children a noble education: in regard to their teachers, their\ncurricula, and their educational aims, our higher schools are one and all\nestablished upon a fundamentally doubtful mediocre basis. Everywhere, too, a\nhastiness which is unbecoming rules supreme; just as if something would be\nforfeited if the young man were not \u201cfinished\u201d at the age of twenty-three, or\ndid not know how to reply to the most essential question, \u201cwhich calling to\nchoose?\u201d\u2014The superior kind of man, if you please, does not like \u201ccallings,\u201d\nprecisely because he knows himself to be called.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 91628, "end_char_idx": 95828, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a216e710-6c64-4b76-a210-a8e351d6e5e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "a216e710-6c64-4b76-a210-a8e351d6e5e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "52ce8356-28ca-4fd0-8eb5-1ff3aabc8a3b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ccacc582c0a976ac41dcb5ef4cb24995eba34bf63d001bc0cdd72802091e1e89", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "81a9d82c-1710-458d-8aeb-4e7267b3bee9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "e0498e65469668607df1c6f55f907a04c56762064f127ff9d906eb4923e697b7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2152799a-fb23-4278-8a0f-b4ff81c47f96", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0b8e9fe824c6b3b8b08f3369a8d0e9a3463564ef4d5ddf9a5272fb774fb1f2ea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In modern Germany nobody is at liberty to\ngive his children a noble education: in regard to their teachers, their\ncurricula, and their educational aims, our higher schools are one and all\nestablished upon a fundamentally doubtful mediocre basis.

He has time, he takes time,\nhe cannot possibly think of becoming \u201cfinished,\u201d\u2014in the matter of higher\nculture, a man of thirty years is a beginner, a child. Our overcrowded public-\nschools, our accumulation of foolishly manufactured public-school masters, are\na scandal: maybe there are very serious _motives_ for defending this state of\naffairs, as was shown quite recently by the professors of Heidelberg; but\nthere can be no reasons for doing so.\n\n6\n\nIn order to be true to my nature, which is affirmative and which concerns\nitself with contradictions and criticism only indirectly and with reluctance,\nlet me state at once what the three objects are for which we need educators.\nPeople must learn to see; they must learn to think, and they must learn to\nspeak and to write: the object of all three of these pursuits is a noble\nculture. To learn to see\u2014to accustom the eye to calmness, to patience, and to\nallow things to come up to it; to defer judgment, and to acquire the habit of\napproaching and grasping an individual case from all sides. This is the first\npreparatory schooling of intellectuality. One must not respond immediately to\na stimulus; one must acquire a command of the obstructing and isolating\ninstincts. To learn to see, as I understand this matter, amounts almost to\nthat which in popular language is called \u201cstrength of will\u201d: its essential\nfeature is precisely _not_ to _wish_ to see, to be able to postpone one\u2019s\ndecision. All lack of intellectuality, all vulgarity, arises out of the\ninability to resist a stimulus:\u2014one must respond or react, every impulse is\nindulged. In many cases such necessary action is already a sign of morbidity,\nof decline, and a symptom of exhaustion. Almost everything that coarse popular\nlanguage characterises as vicious, is merely that physiological inability to\nrefrain from reacting.\u2014As an instance of what it means to have learnt to see,\nlet me state that a man thus trained will as a learner have become generally\nslow, suspicious, and refractory. With hostile calm he will first allow every\nkind of strange and _new_ thing to come right up to him,\u2014he will draw back his\nhand at its approach. To stand with all the doors of one\u2019s soul wide open, to\nlie slavishly in the dust before every trivial fact, at all times of the day\nto be strained ready for the leap, in order to deposit one\u2019s self, to plunge\none\u2019s self, into other souls and other things, in short, the famous\n\u201cobjectivity\u201d of modern times, is bad taste, it is essentially vulgar and\ncheap.\n\n7\n\nAs to learning how to think\u2014our schools no longer have any notion of such a\nthing. Even at the universities, among the actual scholars in philosophy,\nlogic as a theory, as a practical pursuit, and as a business, is beginning to\ndie out.

He is a revolutionary, but kept within\nbounds by \u201cfunk.\u201d He is embarrassed in the face of everything that is strong\n(public opinion, the Academy, the court, even Port Royal). He is embittered\nagainst everything great in men and things, against everything that believes\nin itself. Enough of a poet and of a female to be able to feel greatness as\npower; he is always turning and twisting, because, like the proverbial worm,\nhe constantly feels that he is being trodden upon. As a critic he has no\nstandard of judgment, no guiding principle, no backbone. Although he possesses\nthe tongue of the Cosmopolitan libertine which can chatter about a thousand\nthings, he has not the courage even to acknowledge his _libertinage._ As a\nhistorian he has no philosophy, and lacks the power of philosophical\nvision,\u2014hence his refusal to act the part of a judge, and his adoption of the\nmask of \u201cobjectivity\u201d in all important matters. His attitude is better in\nregard to all those things in which subtle and effete taste is the highest\ntribunal: in these things he really does have the courage of his own\npersonality\u2014he really does enjoy his own nature\u2014he actually is a _master,_ \u2014In\nsome respects he is a prototype of Baudelaire.\n\n4\n\n\u201c _The Imitation of Christ_ \u201d is one of those books which I cannot even take\nhold of without physical loathing: it exhales a perfume of the eternally\nfeminine, which to appreciate fully one must be a Frenchman or a Wagnerite.\nThis saint has a way of speaking about love which makes even Parisiennes feel\na little curious.\u2014I am told that that _most intelligent_ of Jesuits, Auguste\nComte, who wished to lead his compatriots back to Rome by the circuitous route\nof science, drew his inspiration from this book.

The same applies to that ecstasy which is the outcome of all great\ndesires, all strong passions; the ecstasy of the feast, of the arena, of the\nact of bravery, of victory, of all extreme action; the ecstasy of cruelty; the\necstasy of destruction; the ecstasy following upon certain meteorological\ninfluences, as for instance that of spring-time, or upon the use of narcotics;\nand finally the ecstasy of will, that ecstasy which results from accumulated\nand surging will-power.\u2014The essential feature of ecstasy is the feeling of\nincreased strength and abundance. Actuated by this feeling a man gives of\nhimself to things, _he forces_ them to partake of his riches, he does violence\nto them\u2014this proceeding is called _idealising._ Let us rid ourselves of a\nprejudice here: idealising does not consist, as is generally believed, in a\nsuppression or an elimination of detail or of unessential features. A\nstupendous _accentuation_ of the principal characteristics is by far the most\ndecisive factor at work, and in consequence the minor characteristics vanish.\n\n9\n\nIn this state a man enriches everything from out his own abundance: what he\nsees, what he wills, he sees distended, compressed, strong, overladen with\npower. He transfigures things until they reflect his power,\u2014until they are\nstamped with his perfection. This compulsion to transfigure into the beautiful\nis\u2014Art. Everything\u2014even that which he is not,\u2014is nevertheless to such a man a\nmeans of rejoicing over himself; in Art man rejoices over himself as\nperfection.\u2014It is possible to imagine a contrary state, a specifically anti-\nartistic state of the instincts,\u2014a state in which a man impoverishes,\nattenuates, and draws the blood from everything. And, truth to tell, history\nis full of such anti-artists, of such creatures of low vitality who have no\nchoice but to appropriate everything they see and to suck its blood and make\nit thinner. This is the case with the genuine Christian, Pascal for instance.\nThere is no such thing as a Christian who is also an artist ...

The painter, the\nsculptor, the epic poet are essentially visionaries. In the Dionysian state,\non the other hand, the whole system of passions is stimulated and intensified,\nso that it discharges itself by all the means of expression at once, and vents\nall its power of representation, of imitation, of transfiguration, of\ntransformation, together with every kind of mimicry and histrionic display at\nthe same time. The essential feature remains the facility in transforming, the\ninability to refrain from reaction (\u2014a similar state to that of certain\nhysterical patients, who at the slightest hint assume any r\u00f4le). It is\nimpossible for the Dionysian artist not to understand any suggestion; no\noutward sign of emotion escapes him, he possesses the instinct of\ncomprehension and of divination in the highest degree, just as he is capable\nof the most perfect art of communication. He enters into every skin, into\nevery passion: he is continually changing himself. Music as we understand it\nto-day is likewise a general excitation and discharge of the emotions; but,\nnotwithstanding this, it is only the remnant of a much richer world of\nemotional expression, a mere residuum of Dionysian histrionism. For music to\nbe made possible as a special art, quite a number of senses, and particularly\nthe muscular sense, had to be paralysed (at least relatively: for all rhythm\nstill appeals to our muscles to a certain extent): and thus man no longer\nimitates and represents physically everything he feels, as soon as he feels\nit. Nevertheless that is the normal Dionysian state, and in any case its\nprimitive state. Music is the slowly attained specialisation of this state at\nthe cost of kindred capacities.\n\n11\n\nThe actor, the mime, the dancer, the musician, and the lyricist, are in their\ninstincts fundamentally related; but they have gradually specialised in their\nparticular branch, and become separated\u2014even to the point of contradiction.\nThe lyricist remained united with the musician for the longest period of time;\nand the actor with the dancer. The architect manifests neither a Dionysian nor\nan Apollonian state: In his case it is the great act of will, the will that\nmoveth mountains, the ecstasy of the great will which aspires to art. The most\npowerful men have always inspired architects; the architect has always been\nunder the suggestion of power. In the architectural structure, man\u2019s pride,\nman\u2019s triumph over gravitation, man\u2019s will to power, assume a visible form.\nArchitecture is a sort of oratory of power by means of forms. Now it is\npersuasive, even flattering, and at other times merely commanding. The highest\nsensation of power and security finds expression in grandeur of style. That\npower which no longer requires to be proved, which scorns to please; which\nresponds only with difficulty; which feels no witnesses around it; which is\noblivious of the fact that it is being opposed; which relies on itself\nfatalistically, and is a law among laws:\u2014such power expresses itself quite\nnaturally in grandeur of style.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 111164, "end_char_idx": 115364, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8714f562-5645-4073-8b36-fe4011b47bcd": {"__data__": {"id_": "8714f562-5645-4073-8b36-fe4011b47bcd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "52ce8356-28ca-4fd0-8eb5-1ff3aabc8a3b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ccacc582c0a976ac41dcb5ef4cb24995eba34bf63d001bc0cdd72802091e1e89", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "16cf7327-b011-457f-941c-ef07e20ba156", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "027b6ffee0c3552c1ffdb8686b93045fae9cf5b878aaa113f9fe0e4ea26a3155", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cc65655b-8fdc-458f-8280-cf2b210e6431", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cbbd66e0f144f0cc9b8fd3276718c64702932af7b34a289f77af1b7a96ee8af5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The most\npowerful men have always inspired architects; the architect has always been\nunder the suggestion of power.

To yearn for a strong faith is not the proof of a strong faith,\nbut rather the reverse. If a man have a strong faith he can indulge in the\nluxury of scepticism; he is strong enough, firm enough, well-knit enough for\nsuch a luxury. Carlyle stupefies something in himself by means of the\n_fortissimo_ of his reverence for men of a strong faith, and his rage over\nthose who are less foolish: he is in sore need of noise. An attitude of\nconstant and passionate dishonesty towards himself\u2014this is his _proprium;_ by\nvirtue of this he is and remains interesting.\u2014Of course, in England he is\nadmired precisely on account of his honesty. Well, that is English; and in\nview of the fact that the English are the nation of consummate cant, it is not\nonly comprehensible but also very natural. At bottom, Carlyle is an English\natheist who makes it a point of honour not to be one.\n\n13\n\n_Emerson._ \u2014He is much more enlightened, much broader, more versatile, and\nmore subtle than Carlyle; but above all, he is happier. He is one who\ninstinctively lives on ambrosia and who leaves the indigestible parts of\nthings on his plate. Compared with Carlyle he is a man of taste.\u2014Carlyle, who\nwas very fond of him, nevertheless declared that \u201che does not give us enough\nto chew.\u201d This is perfectly true but it is not unfavourable to\nEmerson.\u2014Emerson possesses that kindly intellectual cheerfulness which\ndeprecates overmuch seriousness; he has absolutely no idea of how old he is\nalready, and how young he will yet be,\u2014he could have said of himself, in Lope\nde Vega\u2019s words: \u201c _yo me sucedo a mi mismo._ \u201d His mind is always finding\nreasons for being contented and even thankful; and at times he gets preciously\nnear to that serene superiority of the worthy bourgeois who returning from an\namorous rendezvous _tamquam re bene gesta,_ said gratefully \u201c _Ut desint\nvires, tamen est laudanda voluptas._ \u201d\u2014\n\n14\n\n_Anti-Darwin._ \u2014As to the famous \u201cstruggle for existence,\u201d it seems to me, for\nthe present, to be more of an assumption than a fact. It does occur, but as an\nexception. The general condition of life is not one of want or famine, but\nrather of riches, of lavish luxuriance, and even of absurd prodigality,\u2014where\nthere is a struggle, it is a struggle for power. We should not confound\nMalthus with nature.\u2014Supposing, however, that this struggle exists,\u2014and it\ndoes indeed occur,\u2014its result is unfortunately the very reverse of that which\nthe Darwinian school seems to desire, and of that which in agreement with them\nwe also might desire: that is to say, it is always to the disadvantage of the\nstrong, the privileged, and the happy exceptions.

Examine him a little\nmore closely! Maybe he wishes to derive a more wicked advantage from his\npossession; namely, to feel superior to men, to be able to look down upon\nthem, no longer to feel one of them. This \u201cdisinterested person\u201d is a despiser\nof mankind; and the former is of a more humane type, whatever appearances may\nseem to say to the contrary. At least he considers himself the equal of those\nabout him, at least he classifies himself with them.\n\n16\n\n_The psychological tact_ of Germans seems to me to have been set in doubt by a\nwhole series of cases which my modesty forbids me to enumerate.

I strongly suspect that this growth is\nunable to flourish in the mild climate of our culture. Hypocrisy belongs to an\nage of strong faith,\u2014one in which one does not lose one\u2019s own faith in spite\nof the fact that one has to make an outward show of holding another faith.\nNowadays a man gives it up; or, what is still more common, he acquires a\nsecond faith,\u2014in any case, however, he remains honest. Without a doubt it is\npossible to have a much larger number of convictions at present, than it was\nformerly: _possible_ \u2014that is to say, allowable,\u2014that is to say, _harmless._\nFrom this there arises an attitude of toleration towards one\u2019s self.\nToleration towards one\u2019s self allows of a greater number of convictions: the\nlatter live comfortably side by side, and they take jolly good care, as all\nthe world does to-day, not to compromise themselves. How does a man compromise\nhimself to-day? When he is consistent; when he pursues a straight course; when\nhe has anything less than five faces; when he is genuine.... I very greatly\nfear that modern man is much too fond of comfort for certain vices; and the\nconsequence is that the latter are dying out. Everything evil which is the\noutcome of strength of will\u2014and maybe there is nothing evil without the\nstrengh of will,\u2014degenerates, in our muggy atmosphere, into virtue. The few\nhypocrites I have known only imitated hypocrisy: like almost every tenth man\nto-day, they were actors.\u2014\n\n19\n\n_Beautiful and Ugly:_ \u2014Nothing is more relative, let us say, more restricted,\nthan our sense of the beautiful. He who would try to divorce it from the\ndelight man finds in his fellows, would immediately lose his footing. \u201cBeauty\nin itself,\u201d is simply a word, it is not even a concept. In the beautiful, man\npostulates himself as the standard of perfection; in exceptional cases he\nworships himself as that standard. A species has no other alternative than to\nsay \u201cyea\u201d to itself alone, in this way. Its lowest instinct, the instinct of\nself-preservation and self-expansion, still radiates in such sublimities. Man\nimagines the world itself to be overflowing with beauty,\u2014he forgets that he is\nthe cause of it all. He alone has endowed it with beauty. Alas! and only with\nhuman all-too-human beauty! Truth to tell man reflects himself in things, he\nthinks everything beautiful that throws his own image back at him. The\njudgment \u201cbeautiful\u201d is the \u201cvanity of his species.\u201d ... A little demon of\nsuspicion may well whisper into the sceptic\u2019s ear: is the world really\nbeautified simply because man thinks it beautiful? He has only humanised\nit\u2014that is all. But nothing, absolutely nothing proves to us that it is\nprecisely man who is the proper model of beauty. Who knows what sort of figure\nhe would cut in the eyes of a higher judge of taste? He might seem a little\n_outr\u00e9_? perhaps even somewhat amusing? perhaps a trifle arbitrary? \u201cO\nDionysus, thou divine one, why dost thou pull mine ears?\u201d Ariadne asks on one\noccasion of her philosophic lover, during one of those famous conversations on\nthe island of Naxos. \u201cI find a sort of humour in thine ears, Ariadne: why are\nthey not a little longer?\u201d\n\n20\n\nNothing is beautiful; man alone is beautiful: all \u00e6sthetic rests on this piece\nof ingenuousness, it is the first axiom of this science.

The effect of ugliness may be gauged by the\ndynamometer.

In both cases an inference is\ndrawn; the premises to which are stored with extra ordinary abundance in the\ninstincts. Ugliness is understood to signify a hint and a symptom of\ndegeneration: that which reminds us however remotely of degeneracy, impels us\nto the judgment \u201cugly.\u201d Every sign of exhaustion, of gravity, of age, of\nfatigue; every kind of constraint, such as cramp, or paralysis; and above all\nthe smells, colours and forms associated with decomposition and putrefaction,\nhowever much they may have been attenuated into symbols,\u2014all these things\nprovoke the same reaction which is the judgment \u201cugly.\u201d A certain hatred\nexpresses itself here: what is it that man hates? Without a doubt it is the\n_decline of his type._ In this regard his hatred springs from the deepest\ninstincts of the race: there is horror, caution, profundity and far-reaching\nvision in this hatred,\u2014it is the most profound hatred that exists. On its\naccount alone Art is profound.\n\n21\n\n_Schopenhauer._ \u2014Schopenhauer, the last German who is to be reckoned with\n(\u2014who is a European event like Goethe, Hegel, or Heinrich Heine, and who is\nnot merely local, national), is for a psychologist a case of the first rank: I\nmean as a malicious though masterly attempt to enlist on the side of a general\nnihilistic depreciation of life, the very forces which are opposed to such a\nmovement,\u2014that is to say, the great self-affirming powers of the \u201cwill to\nlive,\u201d the exuberant forms of life itself. He interpreted Art, heroism,\ngenius, beauty, great sympathy, knowledge, the will to truth, and tragedy, one\nafter the other, as the results of the denial, or of the need of the denial,\nof the \u201cwill\u201d\u2014the greatest forgery, Christianity always excepted, which\nhistory has to show. Examined more carefully, he is in this respect simply the\nheir of the Christian interpretation; except that he knew how to approve in a\nChristian fashion (_i.e._ , nihilistically) even of the great facts of human\nculture, which Christianity completely repudiates. (He approved of them as\npaths to \u201csalvation,\u201d as preliminary stages to \u201csalvation,\u201d as _appetisers_\ncalculated to arouse the desire for \u201csalvation.\u201d)\n\n22\n\nLet me point to one single instance. Schopenhauer speaks of beauty with\nmelancholy ardour,\u2014why in sooth does he do this? Because in beauty he sees a\nbridge on which one can travel further, or which stimulates one\u2019s desire to\ntravel further. According to him it constitutes a momentary emancipation from\nthe \u201cwill\u201d\u2014it lures to eternal salvation. He values it more particularly as a\ndeliverance from the \u201cburning core of the will\u201d which is sexuality,\u2014in beauty\nhe recognises the negation of the procreative instinct. Singular Saint! Some\none contradicts thee; I fear it is Nature. Why is there beauty of tone,\ncolour, aroma, and of rhythmic movement in Nature at all? What is it forces\nbeauty to the fore? Fortunately, too, a certain philosopher contradicts him.\nNo less an authority than the divine Plato himself (thus does Schopenhauer\ncall him), upholds another proposition: that all beauty lures to\nprocreation,\u2014that this precisely is the chief characteristic of its effect,\nfrom the lowest sensuality to the highest spirituality.\n\n23\n\nPlato goes further.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 124177, "end_char_idx": 128281, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e426bc27-5e7b-4387-b0f3-17fbacdfbf6f": {"__data__": {"id_": "e426bc27-5e7b-4387-b0f3-17fbacdfbf6f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "52ce8356-28ca-4fd0-8eb5-1ff3aabc8a3b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ccacc582c0a976ac41dcb5ef4cb24995eba34bf63d001bc0cdd72802091e1e89", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fa24856b-13cc-4733-bb6b-86650260e179", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "fbd7eb0045150063c7806d681ba338d9b394e72103c9ee4d3cd95dc53f223942", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "78170561-1cd5-4b6d-8d21-29a9eedb4485", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "233cea765958c69fdb65ac068d2579faac5f48a72e2769a68d0806972c4e4d72", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "According to him it constitutes a momentary emancipation from\nthe \u201cwill\u201d\u2014it lures to eternal salvation.

With an innocence for which a man must be Greek and not\n\u201cChristian,\u201d he says that there would be no such thing as Platonic philosophy\nif there were not such beautiful boys in Athens: it was the sight of them\nalone that set the soul of the philosopher reeling with erotic passion, and\nallowed it no rest until it had planted the seeds of all lofty things in a\nsoil so beautiful. He was also a singular saint!\u2014One scarcely believes one\u2019s\nears, even supposing one believes Plato. At least one realises that philosophy\nwas pursued differently in Athens; above all, publicly. Nothing is less Greek\nthan the cobweb-spinning with concepts by an anchorite, _amor intellectualis\ndei_ after the fashion of Spinoza. Philosophy according to Plato\u2019s style might\nbe defined rather as an erotic competition, as a continuation and a\nspiritualisation of the old agonal gymnastics and the conditions on which they\ndepend.... What was the ultimate outcome of this philosophic eroticism of\nPlato\u2019s? A new art-form of the Greek _Agon,_ dialectics.\u2014In opposition to\nSchopenhauer and to the honour of Plato, I would remind you that all the\nhigher culture and literature of classical France, as well, grew up on the\nsoil of sexual interests. In all its manifestations you may look for\ngallantry, the senses, sexual competition, and \u201cwoman,\u201d and you will not look\nin vain.\n\n24\n\n_L\u2019Art pour l\u2019Art._ \u2014The struggle against a purpose in art is always a\nstruggle against the moral tendency in art, against its subordination to\nmorality. _L\u2019art pour l\u2019art_ means, \u201clet morality go to the devil!\u201d \u2014But even\nthis hostility betrays the preponderating power of the moral prejudice. If art\nis deprived of the purpose of preaching morality and of improving mankind, it\ndoes not by any means follow that art is absolutely pointless, purposeless,\nsenseless, in short _l\u2019art pour l\u2019art_ \u2014a snake which bites its own tail. \u201cNo\npurpose at all is better than a moral purpose!\u201d\u2014thus does pure passion speak.\nA psychologist, on the other hand, puts the question: what does all art do?\ndoes it not praise? does it not glorify? does it not select? does it not bring\nthings into prominence? In all this it strengthens or weakens certain\nvaluations. Is this only a secondary matter? an accident? something in which\nthe artist\u2019s instinct has no share? Or is it not rather the very prerequisite\nwhich enables the artist to accomplish something?... Is his most fundamental\ninstinct concerned with art? Is it not rather concerned with the purpose of\nart, with life? with a certain desirable kind of life? Art is the great\nstimulus to life; how can it be regarded as purpose less, as pointless, as\n_l\u2019art pour l\u2019art?_ \u2014There still remains one question to be answered: Art also\nreveals much that is ugly, hard and questionable in life,\u2014does it not thus\nseem to make life intolerable?\u2014And, as a matter of fact, there have been\nphilosophers who have ascribed this function to art. According to\nSchopenhauer\u2019s doctrine, the general object of art was to \u201cfree one from the\nWill\u201d; and what he honoured as the great utility of tragedy, was that it \u201cmade\npeople more resigned.\u201d\u2014But this, as I have already shown, is a pessimistic\nstandpoint; it is the \u201cevil eye\u201d: the artist himself must be appealed to.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 127465, "end_char_idx": 131523, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78170561-1cd5-4b6d-8d21-29a9eedb4485": {"__data__": {"id_": "78170561-1cd5-4b6d-8d21-29a9eedb4485", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "52ce8356-28ca-4fd0-8eb5-1ff3aabc8a3b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ccacc582c0a976ac41dcb5ef4cb24995eba34bf63d001bc0cdd72802091e1e89", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e426bc27-5e7b-4387-b0f3-17fbacdfbf6f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "3fb21833b89912b8e278314a8df2da74c064cf75e5e38b9ae769e6928b6876cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "906873be-204b-4b49-a540-5881b5216dba", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "37886588d08da972a74e8e4fbf7346d1538bec57b540f896a00c64246fc5fb8e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "with a certain desirable kind of life?

He\nmust communicate, provided he is an artist and a genius in the art of\ncommunication. A courageous and free spirit, in the presence of a mighty foe,\nin the presence of a sublime misfortune, and face to face with a problem that\ninspires horror\u2014this is the triumphant attitude which the tragic artist\nselects and which he glorifies. The martial elements in our soul celebrate\ntheir Saturnalia in tragedy; he who is used to suffering, he who looks out for\nsuffering, the heroic man, extols his existence by means of tragedy,\u2014to him\nalone does the tragic artist offer this cup of sweetest cruelty.\u2014\n\n25\n\nTo associate in an amiable fashion with anybody; to keep the house of one\u2019s\nheart open to all, is certainly liberal: but it is nothing else. One can\nrecognise the hearts that are capable of noble hospitality, by their wealth of\nscreened windows and closed shutters: they keep their best rooms empty.\nWhatever for?\u2014Because they are expecting guests who are somebodies.\n\n26\n\nWe no longer value ourselves sufficiently highly when we communicate our\nsoul\u2019s content. Our real experiences are not at all garrulous. They could not\ncommunicate themselves even if they wished to. They are at a loss to find\nwords for such confidences. Those things for which we find words, are things\nwehave already overcome. In all speech there lies an element of contempt.\nSpeech, it would seem, was only invented for average, mediocre and\ncommunicable things.\u2014Every spoken word proclaims the speaker\nvulgarised\u2014(Extract from a moral code for deaf-and-dumb people and other\nphilosophers.)\n\n27\n\n\u201cThis picture is perfectly\nbeautiful!\u201d[[4]](1418498124915300953_52263-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_4_11) The\ndissatisfied and exasperated literary woman with a desert in her heart and in\nher belly, listening with agonised curiosity every instant to the imperative\nwhich whispers to her from the very depths of her being: _aut liberi, aut\nlibri:_ the literary woman, sufficiently educated to understand the voice of\nnature, even when nature speaks Latin, and moreover enough of a peacock and a\ngoose to speak even French with herself in secret \u201c _Je me verrai, je me\nlirai, je m\u2019extasierai et je dirai: Possible, que j\u2019aie eu tant d\u2019esprit?_ \u201d\n...\n\n28\n\nThe objective ones speak.\u2014\u201cNothing comes more easily to us, than to be wise,\npatient, superior.

Every individual may be classified according to\nwhether he represents the ascending or the descending line of life. When this\nis decided, a canon is obtained by means of which the value of his selfishness\nmay be determined. If he represent the ascending line of life, his value is of\ncourse extraordinary\u2014and for the sake of the collective life which in him\nmakes one step _forward,_ the concern about his maintenance, about procuring\nhis _optimum_ of conditions may even be extreme. The human unit, the\n\u201cindividual,\u201d as the people and the philosopher have always understood him, is\ncertainly an error: he is nothing in himself, no atom, no \u201clink in the chain,\u201d\nno mere heritage from the past,\u2014he represents the whole direct line of mankind\nup to his own life.... If he represent declining development, decay, chronic\ndegeneration, sickness (\u2014illnesses are on the whole already the outcome of\ndecline, and not the cause thereof), he is of little worth, and the purest\nequity would have him _take away_ as little as possible from those who are\nlucky strokes of nature. He is then only a parasite upon them....\n\n34\n\n_The Christian and the Anarchist._ \u2014When the anarchist, as the mouthpiece of\nthe decaying strata of society, raises his voice in splendid indignation for\n\u201cright,\u201d \u201cjustice,\u201d \u201cequal rights,\u201d he is only groaning under the burden of\nhis ignorance, which cannot understand _why_ he actually suffers,\u2014what his\npoverty consists of\u2014the poverty of life. An instinct of causality is active in\nhim: someone must be responsible for his being so ill at ease. His \u201csplendid\nindignation\u201d alone relieves him somewhat, it is a pleasure for all poor devils\nto grumble\u2014it gives them a little intoxicating sensation of power. The very\nact of complaining, the mere fact that one bewails one\u2019s lot, may lend such a\ncharm to life that on that account alone, one is ready to endure it. There is\na small dose of revenge in every lamentation. One casts one\u2019s afflictions,\nand, under certain circumstances, even one\u2019s baseness, in the teeth of those\nwho are different, as if their condition were an injustice, an _iniquitous_\nprivilege. \u201cSince I am _a blackguard_ you ought to be one too.\u201d It is upon\nsuch reasoning that revolutions are based.\u2014To bewail one\u2019s lot is always\ndespicable: it is always the outcome of weakness. Whether one ascribes one\u2019s\nafflictions to others or to _one\u2019s self,_ it is all the same. The socialist\ndoes the former, the Christian, for instance, does the latter. That which is\ncommon to both attitudes, or rather that which is equally ignoble in them\nboth, is the fact that somebody must be to _blame_ if one suffers\u2014in short\nthat the sufferer drugs himself with the honey of revenge to allay his\nanguish. The objects towards which this lust of vengeance, like a lust of\npleasure, are directed, are purely accidental causes. In all directions the\nsufferer finds reasons for cooling his petty passion for revenge. If he is a\nChristian, I repeat, he finds these reasons in himself.

The best are lacking\nwhen selfishness begins to be lacking. Instinctively to select that which is\nharmful to one, to be _lured_ by \u201cdisinterested\u201d motives,\u2014these things almost\nprovide the formula for decadence. \u201cNot to have one\u2019s own interests at heart\u201d\n\u2014this is simply a moral fig-leaf concealing a very different fact, a\nphysiological one, to wit:\u2014\u201cI no longer know how to find what is to my\ninterest.\u201d... Disintegration of the instincts!\u2014All is up with man when he\nbecomes altruistic.\u2014Instead of saying ingenuously \u201cI am no longer any good,\u201d\nthe lie of morality in the decadent\u2019s mouth says: \u201cNothing is any good,\u2014life\nis no good.\u201d\u2014A judgment of this kind ultimately becomes a great danger; for it\nis infectious, and it soon flourishes on the polluted soil of society with\ntropical luxuriance, now as a religion (Christianity), anon as a philosophy\n(Schopenhauerism). In certain circumstances the mere effluvia of such a\nvenomous vegetation, springing as it does out of the very heart of\nputrefaction, can poison life for thousands and thousands of years.\n\n36\n\n_A moral for doctors._ \u2014The sick man is a parasite of society. In certain\ncases it is indecent to go on living. To continue to vegetate in a state of\ncowardly dependence upon doctors and special treatments, once the meaning of\nlife, the right to life, has been lost, ought to be regarded with the greatest\ncontempt by society. The doctors, for their part, should be the agents for\nimparting this contempt,\u2014they should no longer prepare prescriptions, but\nshould every day administer a fresh dose of _disgust_ to their patients. A new\nresponsibility should be created, that of the doctor\u2014the responsibility of\nruthlessly suppressing and eliminating _degenerate_ life, in all cases in\nwhich the highest interests of life itself, of ascending life, demand such a\ncourse\u2014for instance in favour of the right of procreation, in favour of the\nright of being born, in favour of the right to live. One should die proudly\nwhen it is no longer possible to live proudly.

We should never forgive\nChristianity for having so abused the weakness of the dying man as to do\nviolence to his conscience, or for having used his manner of dying as a means\nof valuing both man and his past\u2014In spite of all cowardly prejudices, it is\nour duty, in this respect, above all to reinstate the proper\u2014that is to say,\nthe physiological, aspect of so-called _natural_ death, which after all is\nperfectly \u201cunnatural\u201d and nothing else than suicide. One never perishes\nthrough anybody\u2019s fault but one\u2019s own. The only thing is that the death which\ntakes place in the most contemptible circumstances, the death that is not\nfree, the death which occurs at the wrong time, is the death of a coward. Out\nof the very love one bears to life, one should wish death to be different from\nthis\u2014that is to say, free, deliberate, and neither a matter of chance nor of\nsurprise. Finally let me whisper a word of advice to our friends the\npessimists and all other decadents. We have not the power to prevent ourselves\nfrom being born: but this error\u2014for sometimes it is an error\u2014can be rectified\nif we choose. The man who does away with himself, performs the most estimable\nof deeds: he almost deserves to live for having done so. Society\u2014nay, life\nitself, derives more profit from such a deed than from any sort of life spent\nin renunciation, an\u00e6mia and other virtues,\u2014at least the suicide frees others\nfrom the sight of him, at least he removes one objection against life.\nPessimism _pur et vert,_ can _be proved only_ by the self-refutation of the\npessimists themselves: one should go a step further in one\u2019s consistency; one\nshould not merely deny life with \u201cThe World as Will and Idea,\u201d as Schopenhauer\ndid; one should in the first place _deny Schopenhauer._ ... Incidentally,\nPessimism, however infectious it may be, does not increase the morbidness of\nan age or of a whole species; it is rather the expression of that morbidness.\nOne falls a victim to it in the same way as one falls a victim to cholera; one\nmust already be predisposed to the disease. Pessimism in itself does not\nincrease the number of the world\u2019s _decadents_ by a single unit. Let me remind\nyou of the statistical fact that in those years in which cholera rages, the\ntotal number of deaths does not exceed that of other years.\n\n37\n\n_Have we become more moral?_ \u2014As might have been expected, the whole\n_ferocity_ of moral stultification, which, as is well known, passes for\nmorality itself in Germany, hurled itself against my concept \u201cBeyond Good and\nEvil.\u201d I could tell you some nice tales about this.

We modern men, so extremely delicate and\nsusceptible, full of consideration one for the other, actually dare to suppose\nthat the pampering fellow-feeling which we all display, this unanimity which\nwe have at last acquired in sparing and helping and trusting one another marks\na definite step forward, and shows us to be far ahead of the man of the\nRenaissance. But every age thinks the same, it is _bound_ to think the same.\nThis at least, is certain, that we should not dare to stand amid the\nconditions which prevailed at the Renaissance, we should not even dare to\nimagine ourselves in those conditions: our nerves could not endure that\nreality, not to speak of our muscles. The inability to do this however does\nnot denote any progress; but simply the different and more senile quality of\nour particular nature, its greater weakness, delicateness, and susceptibility,\nout of which a morality _more rich in consideration_ was bound to arise. If we\nimagine our delicateness and senility, our physiological decrepitude as non-\nexistent, our morality of \u201chumanisation\u201d would immediately lose all value\u2014no\nmorality has any value _per se_ \u2014it would even fill us with scorn. On the\nother hand, do not let us doubt that we moderns, wrapped as we are in the\nthick cotton wool of our humanitarianism which would shrink even from grazing\na stone, would present a comedy to C\u00e6sar Borgia\u2019s contemporaries which would\nliterally make them die of laughter. We are indeed, without knowing it,\nexceedingly ridiculous with our modern \u201cvirtues.\u201d ... The decline of the\ninstincts of hostility and of those instincts that arouse suspicion,\u2014for this\nif anything is what constitutes our progress\u2014is only one of the results\nmanifested by the general decline in _vitality_ : it requires a hundred times\nmore trouble and caution to live such a dependent and senile existence. In\nsuch circumstances everybody gives everybody else a helping hand, and, to a\ncertain extent, everybody is either an invalid or an invalid\u2019s attendant. This\nis then called \u201cvirtue\u201d: among those men who knew a different life\u2014that is to\nsay, a fuller, more prodigal, more superabundant sort of life, it might have\nbeen called by another name,\u2014possibly \u201ccowardice,\u201d or \u201cvileness,\u201d or \u201cold\nwoman\u2019s morality.\u201d ...

Strong ages and noble cultures see something\ncontemptible in pity, in the \u201clove of one\u2019s neighbour,\u201d and in a lack of\negoism and of self-esteem.\u2014Ages should be measured according to their\n_positive forces_ ;\u2014valued by this standard that prodigal and fateful age of\nthe Renaissance, appears as the last _great_ age, while we moderns with our\nanxious care of ourselves and love of our neighbours, with all our unassuming\nvirtues of industry, equity, and scientific method\u2014with our lust of\ncollection, of economy and of mechanism\u2014represent a _weak_ age.... Our virtues\nare necessarily determined, and are even stimulated, by our weakness.\n\u201cEquality,\u201d a certain definite process of making everybody uniform, which only\nfinds its expression in the theory of equal rights, is essentially bound up\nwith a declining culture: the chasm between man and man, class and class, the\nmultiplicity of types, the will to be one\u2019s self, and to distinguish one\u2019s\nself\u2014that, in fact, which I call the _pathos of distance_ is proper to all\n_strong_ ages. The force of tension,\u2014nay, the tension itself, between extremes\ngrows slighter every day,\u2014the extremes themselves are tending to become\nobliterated to the point of becoming identical. All our political theories and\nstate constitutions, not by any means excepting \u201cThe German Empire,\u201d are the\nlogical consequences, the necessary consequences of decline; the unconscious\neffect of _decadence_ has begun to dominate even the ideals of the various\nsciences. My objection to the whole of English and French sociology still\ncontinues to be this, that it knows only the _decadent form_ of society from\nexperience, and with perfectly childlike innocence takes the instincts of\ndecline as the norm, the standard, of sociological valuations. _Descending_\nlife, the decay of all organising power\u2014that is to say, of all that power\nwhich separates, cleaves gulfs, and establishes rank above and below,\nformulated itself in modern sociology as _the_ ideal. Our socialists are\ndecadents: but Herbert Spencer was also a _decadent,_ \u2014he saw something to be\ndesired in the triumph of altruism!...\n\n38\n\n_My Concept of Freedom._ \u2014Sometimes the value of a thing does not lie in that\nwhich it helps us to achieve, but in the amount we have to pay for it,\u2014what it\n_costs_ us. For instance, liberal institutions straightway cease from being\nliberal, the moment they are soundly established: once this is attained no\nmore grievous and more thorough enemies of freedom exist than liberal\ninstitutions! One knows, of course, what they bring about: they undermine the\nWill to Power, they are the levelling of mountain and valley exalted to a\nmorality, they make people small, cowardly and pleasure-loving,\u2014by means of\nthem the gregarious animal invariably triumphs. Liberalism, or, in plain\nEnglish, the _transformation of mankind into cattle._ The same institutions,\nso long as they are fought for, produce quite other results; then indeed they\npromote the cause of freedom quite powerfully. Regarded more closely, it is\nwar which produces these results, war in favour of liberal institutions,\nwhich, as war, allows the illiberal instincts to subsist. For war trains men\nto be free.

The nations which\nwere worth anything, which _got to be_ worth anything, never attained to that\ncondition under liberal institutions: _great danger_ made out of them\nsomething which deserves reverence, that danger which alone can make us aware\nof our resources, our virtues, our means of defence, our weapons, our\n_genius,_ \u2014which _compels_ us to be strong. _First_ principle: a man must need\nto be strong, otherwise he will never attain it.\u2014Those great forcing-houses of\nthe strong, of the strongest kind of men that have ever existed on earth, the\naristocratic communities like those of Rome and Venice, understood freedom\nprecisely as I understand the word: as something that one has and that one has\n_not,_ as something that one _will_ have and that one _seizes by force._\n\n39\n\n_A Criticism of Modernity._ \u2014Our institutions are no longer any good; on this\npoint we are all agreed. But the fault does not lie with them; but with _us._\nNow that we have lost all the instincts out of which institutions grow, the\nlatter on their part are beginning to disappear from our midst because we are\nno longer fit for them. Democracy has always been the death agony of the power\nof organisation: already in \u201cHuman All-too-Human,\u201d Part I., Aph. 472, I\npointed out that modern democracy, together with its half-measures, of which\nthe \u201cGerman Empire\u201d is an example, was a decaying form of the State. For\ninstitutions to be possible there must exist a sort of will, instinct,\nimperative, which cannot be otherwise than antiliberal to the point of\nwickedness: the will to tradition, to authority, to responsibility for\ncenturies to come, to _solidarity_ in long family lines forwards and backwards\n_in infinitum._ If this will is present, something is founded which resembles\nthe _imperium Romanum;_ or Russia, the _only_ great nation to-day that has\nsome lasting power and grit in her, that can bide her time, that can still\npromise something.\u2014Russia the opposite of all wretched European petty-statism\nand neurasthenia, which the foundation of the German Empire has brought to a\ncrisis.

As an example of this behold _modern_ marriage. All\nreason has obviously been divorced from modern marriage: but this is no\nobjection to matrimony itself but to modernity.

The rational basis of marriage\u2014it lay\nin its absolute indissolubleness: in this way it was given a gravity which\nknew how to make its influence felt, in the face of the accident of sentiment,\npassion and momentary impulse: it lay also in the fact that the responsibility\nof choosing the parties to the contract, lay with the families. By showing\never more and more favour to love-marriages, the very foundation of matrimony,\nthat which alone makes it an institution, has been undermined. No institution\never has been nor ever will be built upon an idiosyncrasy; as I say, marriage\ncannot be based upon \u201clove.\u201d It can be based upon sexual desire; upon the\ninstinct of property (wife and child as possessions); upon the instinct of\ndominion, which constantly organises for itself the smallest form of\ndominion,\u2014the family which _requires_ children and heirs in order to hold\nfast, also in the physiological sense, to a certain quantum of acquired power,\ninfluence and wealth, so as to prepare for lasting tasks, and for solidarity\nin the instincts from one century to another.

The instincts contradict, disturb, and destroy each other; I have\nalready defined modernism as physiological self-contradiction. A reasonable\nsystem of education would insist upon at least one of these instinct-systems\nbeing _paralysed_ beneath an iron pressure, in order to allow others to assert\ntheir power, to grow strong, and to dominate. At present, the only conceivable\nway of making the individual possible would be to _prune_ him:\u2014of making him\npossible\u2014that is to say, _whole._ The very reverse occurs. Independence, free\ndevelopment, and _laisser aller_ are clamoured for most violently precisely by\nthose for whom no restraint _could be too severe_ \u2014this is true _in politics,_\nit is true in Art. But this is a symptom of decadence: our modern notion of\n\u201cfreedom\u201d is one proof the more of the degeneration of instinct.\n\n42\n\n_Where faith is necessary._ \u2014Nothing is more rare among moralists and saints\nthan uprightness; maybe they say the reverse is true, maybe they even believe\nit. For, when faith is more useful, more effective, more convincing than\n_conscious_ hypocrisy, by instinct that hypocrisy forthwith becomes\n_innocent:_ first principle towards the understanding of great saints. The\nsame holds good of philosophers, that other order of saints; their whole\nbusiness compels them to concede only certain truths\u2014that is to say, those by\nmeans of which their particular trade receives the _public_ sanction,\u2014to speak\n\u201cKantingly\u201d: the truths of _practical_ reason. They know what they _must_\nprove; in this respect they are practical,\u2014they recognise each other by the\nfact that they agree upon \u201ccertain truths.\u201d\u2014\u201cThou shalt not lie\u201d\u2014in plain\nEnglish:\u2014 _Beware,_ Mr Philosopher, of speaking the truth....\n\n43\n\n_A quiet hint to Conservatives._ \u2014That which we did not know formerly, and\nknow now, or might know if we chose,\u2014is the fact that a _retrograde\nformation,_ a reversion in any sense or degree, is absolutely impossible. We\nphysiologists, at least, are aware of this. But all priests and moralists have\nbelieved in it,\u2014they wished to drag and screw man back to a former standard of\nvirtue. Morality has always been a Procrustean bed. Even the politicians have\nimitated the preachers of virtue in this matter. There are parties at the\npresent day whose one aim and dream is to make all things adopt the _crab-\nmarch._ But not everyone can be a crab.

When, the\ntension in the bulk has become sufficiently excessive, the most fortuitous\nstimulus suffices in order to call \u201cgenius,\u201d \u201cgreat deeds,\u201d and momentous fate\ninto the world. What then is the good of all environment, historical periods,\n\u201c _Zeitgeist_ \u201d (Spirit of the age) and \u201cpublic opinion\u201d?\u2014Take the case of\nNapoleon. France of the Revolution, and still more of the period preceding the\nRevolution, would have brought forward a type which was the very reverse of\nNapoleon: it actually _did_ produce such a type. And because Napoleon was\nsomething different, the heir of a stronger, more lasting and older\ncivilisation than that which in France was being smashed to atoms he became\nmaster there, he was the only master there. Great men are necessary, the age\nin which they appear is a matter of chance; the fact that they almost\ninvariably master their age is accounted for simply by the fact that they are\nstronger, that they are older, and that power has been stored longer for them.\nThe relation of a genius to his age is that which exists between strength and\nweakness and between maturity and youth: the age is relatively always very\nmuch younger, thinner, less mature, less resolute and more childish. The fact\nthat the general opinion in France at the present day, is utterly different on\nthis very point (in Germany too, but that is of no consequence); the fact that\nin that country the theory of environment\u2014a regular neuropathic notion\u2014has\nbecome sacrosanct and almost scientific, and finds acceptance even among the\nphysiologists, is a very bad, and exceedingly depressing sign. In England too\nthe same belief prevails: but nobody will be surprised at that. The Englishman\nknows only two ways of understanding the genius and the \u201cgreat man\u201d: either\n_democratically_ in the style of Buckle, or religiously after the manner of\nCarlyle.\u2014The danger which great men and great ages represent, is simply\nextraordinary; every kind of exhaustion and of sterility follows in their\nwake. The great man is an end; the great age\u2014the Renaissance for instance,\u2014is\nan end. The genius\u2014in work and in deed,\u2014is necessarily a squanderer: the fact\nthat he spends himself constitutes his greatness. The instinct of self-\npreservation is as it were suspended in him; the overpowering pressure of out-\nflowing energy in him forbids any such protection and prudence. People call\nthis \u201cself-sacrifice,\u201d they praise his \u201cheroism,\u201d his indifference to his own\nwell-being, his utter devotion to an idea, a great cause, a father-land: All\nmisunderstandings.... He flows out, he flows over, he consumes himself, he\ndoes not spare himself,\u2014and does all this with fateful necessity, irrevocably,\ninvoluntarily, just as a river involuntarily bursts its dams.

He lacks the wild and\nsavage state, a form of nature and existence which is freer and more\ndangerous, in which everything that constitutes the shield and the sword in\nthe instinct of the strong man, takes a place by right. Society puts a ban\nupon his virtues; the most spirited instincts inherent in him immediately\nbecome involved with the depressing passions, with suspicion, fear and\ndishonour. But this is almost the recipe for physiological degeneration. When\na man has to do that which he is best suited to do, which he is most fond of\ndoing, not only clandestinely, but also with long suspense, caution and ruse,\nhe becomes an\u00e6mic; and inasmuch as he is always having to pay for his\ninstincts in the form of danger, persecution and fatalities, even his feelings\nbegin to turn against these instincts\u2014he begins to regard them as fatal. It is\nsociety, our tame, mediocre, castrated society, in which an untutored son of\nnature who comes to us from his mountains or from his adventures at sea, must\nnecessarily degenerate into a criminal. Or almost necessarily: for there are\ncases in which such a man shows himself to be stronger than society: the\nCorsican Napoleon is the most celebrated case of this. Concerning the problem\nbefore us, Dostoiewsky\u2019s testimony is of importance\u2014Dostoiewsky who,\nincidentally, was the only psychologist from whom I had anything to learn: he\nbelongs to the happiest windfalls of my life, happier even than the discovery\nof Stendhal. This profound man, who was right ten times over in esteeming the\nsuperficial Germans low, found the Siberian convicts among whom he lived for\nmany years,\u2014those thoroughly hopeless criminals for whom no road back to\nsociety stood open\u2014very different from what even he had expected,\u2014that is to\nsay carved from about the best, hardest and most valuable material that grows\non Russian soil.[[7]](1418498124915300953_52263-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_7_14)\nLet us generalise the case of the criminal; let us imagine creatures who for\nsome reason or other fail to meet with public approval, who know that they are\nregarded neither as beneficent nor useful,\u2014the feeling of the Chandala, who\nare aware that they are not looked upon as equal, but as proscribed, unworthy,\npolluted. The thoughts and actions of all such natures are tainted with a\nsubterranean mouldiness; everything in them is of a paler hue than in those on\nwhose existence the sun shines. But almost all those creatures whom, nowadays,\nwe honour and respect, formerly lived in this semi-sepulchral atmosphere: the\nman of science, the artist, the genius, the free spirit, the actor, the\nbusiness man, and the great explorer. As long as the _priest_ represented the\nhighest type of man, every valuable kind of man was depreciated.... The time\nis coming\u2014this I guarantee\u2014when he will pass as the _lowest_ type, as our\nChandala, as the falsest and most disreputable kind of man.... I call your\nattention to the fact that even now, under the sway of the mildest customs and\nusages which have ever ruled on earth or at least in Europe, every form of\nstanding aside, every kind of prolonged, excessively prolonged concealment,\nevery unaccustomed and obscure form of existence tends to approximate to that\ntype which the criminal exemplifies to perfection. All pioneers of the spirit\nhave, for a while, the grey and fatalistic mark of the Chandala on their\nbrows: _not_ because they are regarded as Chandala, but because they\nthemselves feel the terrible chasm which separates them from all that is\ntraditional and honourable.

Great sacrifices must\nhave been made on the altar ol good taste, for its sake many things must have\nbeen done, and much must have been left undone\u2014the seventeenth century in\nFrance is admirable for both of these things,\u2014in this century there must have\nbeen a principle of selection in respect to company, locality, clothing, the\ngratification of the instinct of sex; beauty must have been preferred to\nprofit, to habit, to opinion and to indolence. The first rule of all:\u2014nobody\nmust \u201clet himself go,\u201d not even when he is alone.\u2014Good things are exceedingly\ncostly:; and in all cases the law obtains that he who possesses them is a\ndifferent person from him who is _acquiring_ them. Everything good is an\ninheritance: that which is not inherited is imperfect, it is simply a\nbeginning. In Athens at the time of Cicero\u2014who expresses his surprise at the\nfact\u2014the men and youths were by far superior in beauty to the women: but what\nhard work and exertions the male sex had for centuries imposed upon itself in\nthe service of beauty! We must not be mistaken in regard to the method\nemployed here: the mere discipline of feelings and thoughts is little better\nthan nil (\u2014it is in this that the great error of German culture, which is\nquite illusory, lies): the _body_ must be persuaded first. The strict\nmaintenance of a distinguished and tasteful demeanour, the obligation of\nfrequenting only those who do not \u201clet themselves go,\u201d is amply sufficient to\nrender one distinguished and tasteful: in two or three generations everything\nhas already _taken deep root._ The fate of a people and of humanity is decided\naccording to whether they begin culture at the _right place\u2014not_ at the \u201csoul\u201d\n(as the fatal superstition of the priests and half-priests would have it): the\nright place is the body, demeanour, diet, physiology\u2014the rest follows as the\nnight the day.... That is why the Greeks remain the _first event in\nculture_\u2014they knew and they _did_ what was needful.

But Rousseau\u2014whither\ndid he want to return?

I\nhate Rousseau, even _in_ the Revolution itself: the latter was the historical\nexpression of this hybrid of idealist and _canaille._ The bloody farce which\nthis Revolution ultimately became, its \u201cimmorality,\u201d concerns me but slightly;\nwhat I loathe however is its Rousseauesque _morality_ \u2014the so-called \u201ctruths\u201d\nof the Revolution, by means of which it still exercises power and draws all\nflat and mediocre things over to its side. The doctrine of equality! ... But\nthere is no more deadly poison than this; for it _seems_ to proceed from the\nvery lips of justice, whereas in reality it draws the curtain down on all\njustice.... \u201cTo equals equality, to unequals inequality\u201d\u2014that would be the\nreal speech of justice and that which follows from it \u201cNever make unequal\nthings equal.\u201d The fact that so much horror and blood are associated with this\ndoctrine of equality, has lent this \u201cmodern idea\u201d _par excellence_ such a halo\nof fire and glory, that the Revolution as a drama has misled even the most\nnoble minds.\u2014That after all is no reason for honouring it the more.\u2014I can see\nonly one who regarded it as it should be regarded\u2014that is to say, with\n_loathing;_ I speak of Goethe.\n\n49\n\n_Goethe_.\u2014No mere German, but a European event: a magnificent attempt to\novercome the eighteenth century by means of a return to nature, by means of an\nascent to the naturalness of the Renaissance, a kind of self-overcoming on the\npart of the century in question.\u2014He bore the strongest instincts of this\ncentury in his breast: its sentimentality, and idolatry of nature, its anti-\nhistoric, idealistic, unreal, and revolutionary spirit (\u2014the latter is only a\nform of the unreal). He enlisted history, natural science, antiquity, as well\nas Spinoza, and above all practical activity, in his service. He drew a host\nof very definite horizons around him; far from liberating himself from life,\nhe plunged right into it; he did not give in; he took as much as he could on\nhis own shoulders, and into his heart. That to which he aspired was _totality_\n; he was opposed to the sundering of reason, sensuality, feeling and will (as\npreached with most repulsive scholasticism by Kant, the antipodes of Goethe);\nhe disciplined himself into a harmonious whole, he _created_ himself. Goethe\nin the midst of an age of unreal sentiment, was a convinced realist: he said\nyea to everything that was like him in this regard,\u2014there was no greater event\nin his life than that _ens realissimum_ , surnamed Napoleon. Goethe conceived\na strong, highly-cultured man, skilful in all bodily accomplishments, able to\nkeep himself in check, having a feeling of reverence for himself, and so\nconstituted as to be able to risk the full enjoyment of naturalness in all its\nrich profusion and be strong enough for this freedom; a man of tolerance, not\nout of weakness but out of strength, because he knows how to turn to his own\nprofit that which would ruin the mediocre nature; a man unto whom nothing is\nany longer forbidden, unless it be weakness either as a vice or as a virtue.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 174875, "end_char_idx": 178865, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cb554199-d285-4e6f-8264-0948f4e615c8": {"__data__": {"id_": "cb554199-d285-4e6f-8264-0948f4e615c8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "52ce8356-28ca-4fd0-8eb5-1ff3aabc8a3b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ccacc582c0a976ac41dcb5ef4cb24995eba34bf63d001bc0cdd72802091e1e89", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "37edc3f5-6115-4ca4-a8d2-e70cc16fe727", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "80944a250465405d5809164c6b3ab026c7eb46dd571533df6ae4991730359646", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "11e7ad73-1b12-4bed-a69a-2623c8c9053f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "90a0ef27d69020f05ac2ce85769ed832ea6a5be5fbc2e290fe1dc1e1fe898aa5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Goethe\nin the midst of an age of unreal sentiment, was a convinced realist: he said\nyea to everything that was like him in this regard,\u2014there was no greater event\nin his life than that _ens realissimum_ , surnamed Napoleon.

My taste, which is perhaps the reverse of tolerant,\nis very far from saying yea through and through even to this world: on the\nwhole it is not over eager to say _Yea,_ it would prefer to say _Nay,_ and\nbetter still nothing whatever.... This is true of whole cultures; it is true\nof books,\u2014it is also true of places and of landscapes. Truth to tell, the\nnumber of ancient books that count for something in my life is but small; and\nthe most famous are not of that number. My sense of style, for the epigram as\nstyle, was awakened almost spontaneously upon my acquaintance with Sallust. I\nhave not forgotten the astonishment of my respected teacher Corssen, when he\nwas forced to give his worst Latin pupil the highest marks,\u2014at one stroke I\nhad learned all there was to learn. Condensed, severe, with as much substance\nas possible in the background, and with cold but roguish hostility towards all\n\u201cbeautiful words\u201d and \u201cbeautiful feelings\u201d\u2014in these things I found my own\nparticular bent.

This mosaic of\nwords, in which every unit spreads its power to the left and to the right over\nthe whole, by its sound, by its place in the sentence, and by its meaning,\nthis _minimum_ in the compass and number of the signs, and the _maximum_ of\nenergy in the signs which is thereby achieved\u2014all this is Roman, and, if you\nwill believe me, noble _par excellence._ By the side of this all the rest of\npoetry becomes something popular,\u2014nothing more than senseless sentimental\ntwaddle.\n\n2\n\nI am not indebted to the Greeks for anything like such strong impressions;\nand, to speak frankly, they cannot be to us what the Romans are. One cannot\n_learn_ from the Greeks\u2014their style is too strange, it is also too fluid, to\nbe imperative or to have the effect of a classic. Who would ever have learnt\nwriting from a Greek! Who would ever have learned it without the Romans!... Do\nnot let anyone suggest Plato to me. In regard to Plato I am a thorough\nsceptic, and have never been able to agree to the admiration of Plato the\n_artist,_ which is traditional among scholars. And after all, in this matter,\nthe most refined judges of taste in antiquity are on my side. In my opinion\nPlato bundles all the forms of style pell-mell together, in this respect he is\none of the first decadents of style: he has something similar on his\nconscience to that which the Cynics had who invented the _satura Menippea._\nFor the Platonic dialogue\u2014this revoltingly self-complacent and childish kind\nof dialectics\u2014to exercise any charm over you, you must never have read any\ngood French authors,\u2014Fontenelle for instance. Plato is boring. In reality my\ndistrust of Plato is fundamental. I find him so very much astray from all the\ndeepest instincts of the Hellenes, so steeped in moral prejudices, so pre-\nexistently Christian\u2014the concept \u201cgood\u201d is already the highest value with\nhim,\u2014that rather than use any other expression I would prefer to designate the\nwhole phenomenon Plato with the hard word \u201csuperior bunkum,\u201d or, if you would\nlike it better, \u201cidealism.\u201d Humanity has had to pay dearly for this Athenian\nhaving gone to school among the Egyptians (\u2014or among the Jews in Egypt?...) In\nthe great fatality of Christianity, Plato is that double-faced fascination\ncalled the \u201cideal,\u201d which made it possible for the more noble natures of\nantiquity to misunderstand themselves and to tread the _bridge_ which led to\nthe \u201ccross.\u201d And what an amount of Plato is still to be found in the concept\n\u201cchurch,\u201d and in the construction, the system and the practice of the\nchurch!\u2014My recreation, my predilection, my cure, after all Platonism, has\nalways been Thucydides. Thucydides and perhaps Machiavelli\u2019s _principe_ are\nmost closely related to me owing to the absolute determination which they show\nof refusing to deceive themselves and of seeing reason in _reality,_ \u2014not in\n\u201crationality,\u201d and still less in \u201cmorality.\u201d There is no more radical cure\nthan Thucydides for the lamentably rose-coloured idealisation of the Greeks\nwhich the \u201cclassically-cultured\u201d stripling bears with him into life, as a\nreward for his public school training.

In him\nthe culture \u201cof the Sophists\u201d\u2014that is to say, the culture of realism, receives\nits most perfect expression: this inestimable movement in the midst of the\nmoral and idealistic knavery of the Socratic Schools which was then breaking\nout in all directions. Greek philosophy is the decadence of the Greek\ninstinct: Thucydides is the great summing up, the final manifestation of that\nstrong, severe positivism which lay in the instincts of the ancient Hellene.\nAfter all, it is courage in the face of reality that distinguishes such\nnatures as Thucydides from Plato: Plato is a coward in the face of\nreality\u2014consequently he takes refuge in the ideal: Thucydides is master of\nhimself,\u2014consequently he is able to master life.\n\n3\n\nTo rout up cases of \u201cbeautiful souls,\u201d \u201cgolden means\u201d and other perfections\namong the Greeks, to admire, say, their calm grandeur, their ideal attitude of\nmind, their exalted simplicity\u2014from this \u201cexalted simplicity,\u201d which after all\nis a piece of _niaiserie allemande,_ I was preserved by the psychologist\nwithin me. I saw their strongest instinct, the Will to Power, I saw them\nquivering with the fierce violence of this instinct,\u2014I saw all their\ninstitutions grow out of measures of security calculated to preserve each\nmember of their society from the inner _explosive material_ that lay in his\nneighbour\u2019s breast. This enormous internal tension thus discharged itself in\nterrible and reckless hostility outside the state: the various states mutually\ntore each other to bits, in order that each individual state could remain at\npeace with itself. It was then necessary to be strong; for danger lay close at\nhand,\u2014it lurked in ambush everywhere. The superb suppleness of their bodies,\nthe daring realism and immorality which is peculiar to the Hellenes, was a\nnecessity not an inherent quality. It was a result, it had not been there from\nthe beginning. Even their festivals and their arts were but means in producing\na feeling of superiority, and of showing it: they are measures of self-\nglorification; and in certain circumstances of making one\u2019s self terrible....\nFancy judging the Greeks in the German style, from their philosophers; fancy\nusing the suburban respectability of the Socratic schools as a key to what is\nfundamentally Hellenic!... The philosophers are of course the decadents of\nHellas, the counter-movement directed against the old and noble taste(\u2014against\nthe agonal instinct, against the _Polls,_ against the value of the race,\nagainst the authority of tradition), Socratic virtues were preached to the\nGreeks, _because_ the Greeks had lost virtue: irritable, cowardly, unsteady,\nand all turned to play-actors, they had more than sufficient reason to submit\nto having morality preached to them.

And\nin his \u201c _Cultur der Griechen_ \u201d Burckhardt inserted a special chapter on the\nphenomenon in question. If you would like a glimpse of the other side, you\nhave only to refer to the almost laughable poverty of instinct among German\nphilologists when they approach the Dionysian question. The celebrated Lobeck,\nespecially, who with the venerable assurance of a worm dried up between books,\ncrawled into this world of mysterious states, succeeded inconvincing himself\nthat he was scientific, whereas he was simply revoltingly superficial and\nchildish,\u2014Lobeck, with all the pomp of profound erudition, gave us to\nunderstand that, as a matter of fact, there was nothing at all in all these\ncuriosities. Truth to tell, the priests may well have communicated not a few\nthings of value to the participators in such orgies; for instance, the fact\nthat wine provokes desire, that man in certain circumstances lives on fruit,\nthat plants bloom in the spring and fade in the autumn. As regards the\nastounding wealth of rites, symbols and myths which take their origin in the\norgy, and with which the world of antiquity is literally smothered, Lobeck\nfinds that it prompts him to a feat of even greater ingenuity than the\nforegoing phenomenon did. \u201cThe Greeks,\u201d he says, (_Aglaophamus,_ I. p. 672),\n\u201cwhen they had nothing better to do, laughed, sprang and romped about, or,\ninasmuch as men also like a change at times, they would sit down, weep and\nbewail their lot. Others then came up who tried to discover some reason for\nthis strange behaviour; and thus, as an explanation of these habits, there\narose an incalculable number of festivals, legends, and myths. On the other\nhand it was believed that the _farcical performances_ which then perchance\nbegan to take place on festival days, necessarily formed part of the\ncelebrations, and they were retained as an indispensable part of the\nritual.\u201d\u2014This is contemptible nonsense, and no one will take a man like Lobeck\nseriously for a moment We are very differently affected when we examine the\nnotion \u201cHellenic,\u201d as Winckelmann and Goethe conceived it, and find it\nincompatible with that element out of which Dionysian art springs\u2014I speak of\norgiasm. In reality I do not doubt that Goethe would have completely excluded\nany such thing from the potentialities of the Greek soul. _Consequently Goethe\ndid not understand the Greeks._ For it is only in the Dionysian mysteries, in\nthe psychology of the Dionysian state, that the _fundamental fact_ of the\nHellenic instinct\u2014its \u201cwill to life\u201d\u2014is expressed. What did the Hellene secure\nhimself with these mysteries? _Eternal_ life, the eternal recurrence of life;\nthe future promised and hallowed in the past; the triumphant Yea to life\ndespite death and change; real life conceived as the collective prolongation\nof life through procreation, through the mysteries of sexuality. To the\nGreeks, the symbol of sex was the most venerated of symbols, the really deep\nsignificance of all the piety of antiquity. All the details of the act of\nprocreation, pregnancy and birth gave rise to the loftiest and most solemn\nfeelings. In the doctrine of mysteries, _pain_ was pronounced holy: the \u201cpains\nof childbirth\u201d sanctify pain in general,\u2014all becoming and all growth,\neverything that guarantees the future _involves_ pain....

In order that there\nmay be eternal joy in creating, in order that the will to life may say Yea to\nitself in all eternity, the \u201cpains of childbirth\u201d must also be eternal. All\nthis is what the word Dionysus signifies: I know of no higher symbolism than\nthis Greek symbolism, this symbolism of the Dionysian phenomenon. In it the\nprofoundest instinct of life, the instinct that guarantees the future of life\nand life eternal, is understood religiously,\u2014the road to life itself,\nprocreation, is pronounced _holy,_ ... It was only Christianity which, with\nits fundamental resentment against life, made something impure out of\nsexuality: it flung _filth_ at the very basis, the very first condition of our\nlife.\n\n5\n\nThe psychology of orgiasm conceived as the feeling of a superabundance of\nvitality and strength, within the scope of which even pain _acts as a\nstimulus,_ gave me the key to the concept _tragic_ feeling, which has been\nmisunderstood not only by Aristotle, but also even more by our pessimists.\nTragedy is so far from proving anything in regard to the pessimism of the\nGreeks, as Schopenhauer maintains, that it ought rather to be considered as\nthe categorical repudiation and _condemnation_ thereof. The saying of Yea to\nlife, including even its most strange and most terrible problems, the will to\nlife rejoicing over its own inexhaustibleness in the _sacrifice_ of its\nhighest types\u2014this is what I called Dionysian, this is what I divined as the\nbridge leading to the psychology of the _tragic_ poet. Not in order to escape\nfrom terror and pity, not to purify one\u2019s self of a dangerous passion by\ndischarging it with vehemence\u2014this is how Aristotle understood it\u2014but to be\nfar beyond terror and pity and to be the eternal lust of Becoming itself\u2014that\nlust which also involves the _lust of destruction._ And with this I once more\ncome into touch with the spot from which I once set out\u2014-the \u201cBirth of\nTragedy\u201d was my first transvaluation of all values: with this I again take my\nstand upon the soil from out of which my will and my capacity spring\u2014I, the\nlast disciple of the philosopher Dionysus,\u2014I, the prophet of eternal\nrecurrence.\n\n##### THE END.\n\n* * *\n\n#### THE HAMMER SPEAKETH\n\n\u201cWhy so hard!\u201d\u2014said the diamond once unto the charcoal; \u201care we then not next\nof kin?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy so soft?

(\u2014Man is an _end_ \u2014); but, what type of man must be _reared,_\nmust be _willed,_ as having the higher value, as being the most worthy of life\nand the surest guarantee of the future.\n\nThis more valuable type has appeared often enough already: but as a happy\naccident, as an exception, never as _willed._ He has rather been precisely the\nmost feared; hitherto he has been almost the terrible in itself;\u2014and from out\nthe very fear he provoked there arose the will to rear the type which has how\nbeen reared, _attained:_ the domestic animal, the gregarious animal, the sick\nanimal man,\u2014the Christian.\n\n4\n\nMankind does _not_ represent a development towards a better, stronger or\nhigher type, in the sense in which this is supposed to occur to-day.\n\u201cProgress\u201d is merely a modern idea\u2014that is to say, a false\nidea.[[2]](1418498124915300953_52263-h-6.htm.html#Footnote_2_18) The modern\nEuropean is still far below the European of the Renaissance in value. The\nprocess of evolution does not by any means imply elevation, enhancement and\nincreasing strength.\n\nOn the other hand isolated and individual cases are continually succeeding in\ndifferent places on earth, as the outcome of the most different cultures, and\nin these a _higher type_ certainly manifests itself: something which by the\nside of mankind in general, represents a kind of superman. Such lucky strokes\nof great success have always been possible and will perhaps always be\npossible. And even whole races, tribes and nations may in certain\ncircumstances represent such _lucky strokes._\n\n5\n\nWe must not deck out and adorn Christianity: it has waged a deadly war upon\nthis _higher_ type of man, it has set a ban upon all the fundamental instincts\nof this type, and has distilled evil and the devil himself out of these\ninstincts:\u2014the strong man as the typical pariah, the villain. Christianity has\nsided with everything weak, low, and botched; it has made an ideal out of\n_antagonism_ towards all the self-preservative instincts of strong life: it\nhas corrupted even the reason of the strongest intellects, by teaching that\nthe highest values of intellectuality are sinful, misleading and full of\ntemptations. The most lamentable example of this was the corruption of Pascal,\nwho believed in the perversion of his reason through original sin, whereas it\nhad only been perverted by his Christianity.\n\n6\n\nA painful and ghastly spectacle has just risen before my eyes.

I tore down the\ncurtain which concealed mankind\u2019s _corruption._ This word in my mouth is at\nleast secure from the suspicion that it contains a moral charge against\nmankind. It is\u2014I would fain emphasise this again\u2014free from moralic acid: to\nsuch an extent is this so, that I am most thoroughly conscious of the\ncorruption in question precisely in those quarters in which hitherto people\nhave aspired with most determination to \u201cvirtue\u201d and to \u201cgodliness.\u201d As you\nhave already surmised, I understand corruption in the sense of _decadence._\nWhat I maintain is this, that all the values upon which mankind builds its\nhighest hopes and desires are _decadent_ values.\n\nI call an animal, a species, an individual corrupt, when it loses its\ninstincts, when it selects and _prefers_ that which is detrimental to it. A\nhistory of the \u201chigher feelings,\u201d of \u201chuman ideals\u201d\u2014and it is not impossible\nthat I shall have to write it\u2014would almost explain why man is so corrupt. Life\nitself, to my mind, is nothing more nor less than the instinct of growth, of\npermanence, of accumulating forces, of power: where the will to power is\nlacking, degeneration sets in. My contention is that all the highest values of\nmankind _lack_ this will,\u2014that the values of decline and of _nihilism_ are\nexercising the sovereign power under the cover of the holiest names.\n\n7\n\nChristianity is called the religion of _pity._ \u2014Pity is opposed to the tonic\npassions which enhance the energy of the feeling of life: its action is\ndepressing. A man loses power when he pities. By means of pity the drain on\nstrength which suffering itself already introduces into the world is\nmultiplied a thousandfold. Through pity, suffering itself becomes infectious;\nin certain circumstances it may lead to a total loss of life and vital energy,\nwhich is absurdly put of proportion to the magnitude of the cause (\u2014the case\nof the death of the Nazarene). This is the first standpoint; but there is a\nstill more important one. Supposing one measures pity according to the value\nof the reactions it usually stimulates, its danger to life appears in a much\nmore telling light On the whole, pity thwarts the law of development which is\nthe law of selection. It preserves that which is ripe for death, it fights in\nfavour of the disinherited and the condemned of life; thanks to the multitude\nof abortions of all kinds which it maintains in life, it lends life itself a\nsombre and questionable aspect. People have dared to call pity a virtue (\u2014in\nevery _noble_ culture it is considered as a weakness\u2014); people went still\nfurther, they exalted it to _the_ virtue, the root and origin of all\nvirtues,\u2014but, of course, what must never be forgotten is the fact that this\nwas done from the standpoint of a philosophy which was nihilistic, and on\nwhose shield the device _The Denial of Life_ was inscribed. Schopenhauer was\nright in this respect: by means of pity, life is denied and made _more worthy\nof denial,_ \u2014pity is the _praxis_ of Nihilism. I repeat, this depressing and\ninfectious instinct thwarts those instincts which aim at the preservation and\nenhancement of the value life: by _multiplying_ misery quite as much as by\npreserving all that is miserable, it is the principal agent in promoting\ndecadence,\u2014pity exhorts people to nothing, to _nonentity!_ But they do not say\n\u201c _nonentity_ \u201d they say \u201cBeyond,\u201d or \u201cGod,\u201d or \u201cthe true life\u201d; or Nirvana,\nor Salvation, or Blessedness, instead.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 203151, "end_char_idx": 207169, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c0a01f4-7423-4dfa-9404-9302017e625f": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c0a01f4-7423-4dfa-9404-9302017e625f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "52ce8356-28ca-4fd0-8eb5-1ff3aabc8a3b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ccacc582c0a976ac41dcb5ef4cb24995eba34bf63d001bc0cdd72802091e1e89", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "50eafa7f-6693-48a9-b1f4-1b8404dbcb27", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "2428ea4c4fa664854549d05f0ddd02dc8fffb469a47bc428dc9805fbde1f31f0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b7dbcc3b-1384-4827-a5cc-ab328f22559e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "482e1d828306787da2ee6c9c618f040a87957b46bc5c0daebc55b2562de53f71", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Schopenhauer was\nright in this respect: by means of pity, life is denied and made _more worthy\nof denial,_ \u2014pity is the _praxis_ of Nihilism.

This innocent rhetoric, which belongs\nto the realm of the religio-moral idiosyncrasy, immediately appears to be\n_very much less innocent_ if one realises what the tendency is which here\ntries to drape itself in the mantle of sublime expressions\u2014the tendency of\nhostility to life. Schopenhauer was hostile to life: that is why he elevated\npity to a virtue.... Aristotle, as you know, recognised in pity a morbid and\ndangerous state, of which it was wise to rid one\u2019s self from time to time by a\npurgative: he regarded tragedy as a purgative. For the sake of the instinct of\nlife, it would certainly seem necessary to find some means of lancing any such\nmorbid and dangerous accumulation of pity, as that which possessed\nSchopenhauer (and unfortunately the whole of our literary and artistic\ndecadence as well, from St Petersburg to Paris, from Tolstoi to Wagner), if\nonly to make it _burst...._ Nothing is more unhealthy in the midst of our\nunhealthy modernity, than Christian pity. To be doctors _here,_ to be\ninexorable _here,_ to wield the knife effectively _here,\u2014_ all this is our\nbusiness, all this is _our_ kind of love to our fellows, this is what makes\n_us_ philosophers, us hyperboreans!\u2014\n\n8\n\nIt is necessary to state whom we regard as our antithesis:\u2014the theologians,\nand all those who have the blood of theologians in their veins\u2014the whole of\nour philosophy.... A man must have had his very nose upon this fatality, or\nbetter still he must have experienced it in his own soul; he must almost have\nperished through it, in order to be unable to treat this matter lightly (\u2014the\nfree-spiritedness of our friends the naturalists and physiologists is, in my\nopinion, a _joke,_ \u2014what they lack in these questions is passion, what they\nlack is having suffered from these questions\u2014). This poisoning extends much\nfurther than people think: I unearthed the \u201carrogant\u201d instinct of the\ntheologian, wherever nowadays people feel themselves idealists,\u2014wherever,\nthanks to superior antecedents, they claim the right to rise above reality and\nto regard it with suspicion.... Like the priest the idealist has every\ngrandiloquent concept in his hand (\u2014and not only in his hand!), he wields them\nall with kindly contempt against the \u201cunderstanding,\u201d the \u201csenses,\u201d \u201chonours,\u201d\n\u201cdecent living,\u201d \u201cscience\u201d; he regards such things as _beneath_ him, as\ndetrimental and seductive forces, upon the face of which, \u201cthe Spirit\u201d moves\nin pure absoluteness:\u2014as if humility, chastity, poverty, in a word _holiness,_\nhad not done incalculably more harm to life hitherto, than any sort of horror\nand vice.... Pure spirit is pure falsehood.... As long as the priest, the\n_professional_ denier, calumniator and poisoner of life, is considered as the\n_highest_ kind of man, there can be no answer to the question, what _is_\ntruth?

The pathos which grows\nout of this state, is called _Faith:_ that is to say, to shut one\u2019s eyes once\nand for all, in order not to suffer at the sight of incurable falsity. People\nconvert this faulty view of all things into a moral, a virtue, a thing of\nholiness. They endow their distorted vision with a good conscience,\u2014they claim\nthat no _other_ point of view is any longer of value, once theirs has been\nmade sacrosanct with the names \u201cGod,\u201d \u201cSalvation,\u201d \u201cEternity.\u201d I unearthed the\ninstinct of the theologian everywhere: it is the most universal, and actually\nthe most subterranean form of falsity on earth. That which a theologian\nconsiders true, _must_ of necessity be false: this furnishes almost the\ncriterion of truth. It is his most profound self-preservative instinct which\nforbids reality ever to attain to honour in any way, or even to raise its\nvoice. Whithersoever the influence of the theologian extends, _valuations_ are\ntopsy-turvy, and the concepts \u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d have necessarily changed\nplaces: that which is most deleterious to life, is here called \u201ctrue,\u201d that\nwhich enhances it, elevates it, says Yea to it, justifies it and renders it\ntriumphant, is called \u201cfalse.\u201d ... If it should happen that theologians, _via_\nthe \u201cconscience\u201d either of princes or of the people, stretch out their hand\nfor power, let us not be in any doubt as to what results therefrom each time,\nnamely:\u2014the will to the end, the _nihilistic_ will to power....\n\n10\n\nAmong Germans I am immediately understood when I say, that philosophy is\nruined by the blood of theologians. The Protestant minister is the grand-\nfather of German philosophy, Protestantism itself is the latter\u2019s _peccatum\noriginale._ Definition of Protestantism: the partial paralysis of\nChristianity\u2014and of reason.... One needs only to pronounce the words \u201cT\u00fcbingen\nSeminary,\u201d in order to understand what German philosophy really is at bottom,\ntheology _in disguise_.... The Swabians are the best liars in Germany, they\nlie innocently.... Whence came all the rejoicing with which the appearance of\nKant was greeted by the scholastic world of Germany, three-quarters of which\nconsist of clergymen\u2019s and schoolmasters\u2019 sons? Whence came the German\nconviction, which finds an echo even now, that Kant inaugurated a change for\nthe _better?_ The theologian\u2019s instinct in the German scholar divined what had\nonce again been made possible.... A back-staircase leading into the old ideal\nwas discovered, the concept \u201ctrue world,\u201d the concept morality as the\n_essence_ of the world (\u2014those two most vicious errors that have ever\nexisted!), were, thanks to a subtle and wily scepticism, once again, if not\ndemonstrable, at least no longer _refutable...._ Reason, the _prerogative_ of\nreason, does not extend so far....

Did\nKant not see in the French Revolution the transition of the State from the\ninorganic to the _organic_ form? Did he not ask himself whether there was a\nsingle event on record which could be explained otherwise than as a moral\nfaculty of mankind; so that by means of it, \u201cmankind\u2019s tendency towards good,\u201d\nmight be _proved_ once and for all?

AH the methods and the first principles\nof our modern scientific procedure, had for years to encounter the profoundest\ncontempt: association with them meant exclusion from the society of decent\npeople\u2014one was regarded as an \u201cenemy of God,\u201d as a scoffer at truth and as\n\u201cone possessed.\u201d With one\u2019s scientific nature, one belonged to the Chandala.\nWe have had the whole feeling of mankind against us; hitherto their notion of\nthat which ought to be truth, of that which ought to serve the purpose of\ntruth: every \u201cthou shalt,\u201d has been directed against us.... Our objects, our\npractices, our calm, cautious distrustful manner\u2014everything about us seemed to\nthem absolutely despicable and beneath contempt After all, it might be asked\nwith some justice, whether the thing which kept mankind blindfold so long,\nwere not an \u00e6sthetic taste: what they demanded of truth was a _picturesque_\neffect, and from the man of science what they expected was that he should make\na forcible appeal to their senses. It was our _modesty_ which ran counter to\ntheir taste so long ... And oh! how well they guessed this, did these divine\nturkey-cocks!\u2014\n\n14\n\nWe have altered our standpoint. In every respect we have become more modest We\nno longer derive man from the \u201cspirit,\u201d and from the \u201cgodhead\u201d; we have thrust\nhim back among the beasts. We regard him as the strongest animal, because he\nis the craftiest: one of the results thereof is his intellectuality. On the\nother hand we guard against the vain pretension, which even here would fain\nassert itself: that man is the great _arri\u00e8re pens\u00e9e_ of organic evolution! He\nis by no means the crown of creation, beside him, every other creature stands\nat the same stage of perfection.... And even in asserting this we go a little\ntoo far; for, relatively speaking, man is the most botched and diseased of\nanimals, and he has wandered furthest from his instincts. Be all this as it\nmay, he is certainly the most _interesting!_ As regards animals, Descartes was\nthe first, with really admirable daring, to venture the thought that the beast\nwas _machina,_ and the whole of our physiology is endeavouring to prove this\nproposition. Moreover, logically we do not set man apart, as Descartes did:\nthe extent to which man is understood to-day goes only so far as he has been\nunderstood mechanistically. Formerly man was given \u201cfree will,\u201d as his dowry\nfrom a higher sphere; nowadays we have robbed him even of will, in view of the\nfact that no such faculty is any longer known. The only purpose served by the\nold word \u201cwill,\u201d is to designate a result, a sort of individual reaction which\nnecessarily follows upon a host of partly discordant and partly harmonious\nstimuli:\u2014the will no longer \u201ceffects\u201d or \u201cmoves\u201d anything.... Formerly people\nthought that man\u2019s consciousness, his \u201cspirit,\u201d was a proof of his lofty\norigin, of his divinity. With the idea of perfecting man, he was conjured to\ndraw his senses inside himself, after the manner of the tortoise, to cut off\nall relations with terrestrial things, and to divest himself of his mortal\nshell.

Nothing but imaginary _causes_ (God, the soul, the ego, spirit, free\nwill\u2014or even non-free will); nothing but imaginary _effects_ (sin, salvation,\ngrace, punishment, forgiveness of sins). Imaginary beings are supposed to have\nintercourse (God, spirits, souls); imaginary Natural History (anthropocentric:\ntotal lack of the notion \u201cnatural causes\u201d); an imaginary _psychology_ (nothing\nbut misunderstandings of self, interpretations of pleasant or unpleasant\ngeneral feelings; for instance of the states of the _nervus sympathicus,_ with\nthe help of the sign language of a religio-moral idiosyncrasy,\u2014repentance,\npangs of conscience, the temptation of the devil, the presence of God); an\nimaginary teleology (the Kingdom of God, the Last Judgment, Everlasting\nLife).\u2014This purely fictitious world distinguishes itself very unfavourably\nfrom the world of dreams: the latter _reflects_ reality, whereas the former\nfalsifies, depreciates and denies it Once the concept \u201cnature\u201d was taken to\nmean the opposite of the concept God, the word \u201cnatural\u201d had to acquire the\nmeaning of abominable,\u2014the whole of that fictitious world takes its root in\nthe hatred of nature (\u2014reality!\u2014), it is the expression of profound\ndiscomfiture in the presence of reality.... _But this explains everything._\nWhat is the only kind of man who has reasons for wriggling out of reality by\nlies?

He then becomes a tremulous and\nunassuming sneak; he counsels \u201cpeace of the soul,\u201d the cessation of all\nhatred, leniency and \u201clove\u201d even towards friend and foe. He is for ever\nmoralising, he crawls into the heart of every private virtue, becomes a God\nfor everybody, he retires from active service and becomes a Cosmopolitan....\nFormerly he represented a people, the strength of a people, everything\naggressive and desirous of power lying concealed in the heart of a nation: now\nhe is merely the good God.... In very truth Gods have no other alternative,\nthey are _either_ the Will to Power\u2014in which case they are always the Gods of\nwhole nations,\u2014or, on the other hand, the incapacity for power\u2014in which case\nthey necessarily become good.\n\n17\n\nWherever the Will to Power, no matter in what form, begins to decline, a\nphysiological retrogression, decadence, always supervenes. The godhead of\n_decadence,_ shorn of its masculine virtues and passions is perforce converted\ninto the God of the physiologically degraded, of the weak. Of course they do\nnot call themselves the weak, they call themselves \u201cthe good.\u201d ... No hint\nwill be necessary to help you to understand at what moment in history the\ndualistic fiction of a good and an evil God first became possible. With the\nsame instinct by which the subjugated reduce their God to \u201cGoodness in\nitself,\u201d they also cancel the good qualities from their conqueror\u2019s God; they\navenge themselves on their masters by diabolising the latter\u2019s God.\u2014The _good\nGod_ and the devil as well:\u2014both the abortions of decadence.\u2014How is it\npossible that we are still so indulgent towards the simplicity of Christian\ntheologians to-day, as to declare with them that the evolution of the concept\nGod, from the \u201cGod of Israel,\u201d the God of a people, to the Christian God, the\nquintessence of all goodness, marks a _step forward?_ \u2014But even Renan does\nthis.

But the God of the \u201cgreatest number,\u201d the democrat among gods, did not\nbecome a proud heathen god notwithstanding: he remained a Jew, he remained the\nGod of the back streets, the God of all dark corners and hovels, of all the\nunwholesome quarters of the world!... His universal empire is now as ever a\nnetherworld empire, an infirmary, a subterranean empire, a ghetto-empire....\nAnd he himself is so pale, so weak, so decadent ...

For being able to compare them at\nall, the critic of Christianity is profoundly grateful to Indian\nscholars.\u2014Buddhism is a hundred times more realistic than Christianity,\u2014it is\npart of its constitutional heritage to be able to face problems objectively\nand coolly, it is the outcome of centuries of lasting philosophical activity.\nThe concept \u201cGod\u201d was already exploded when it appeared. Buddhism is the only\nreally _positive_ religion to be found in history, even in its epistemology\n(which is strict phenomenalism)\u2014it no longer speaks of the \u201cstruggle with\n_sin_ \u201d but fully recognising the true nature of reality it speaks of the\n\u201cstruggle with _pain._ \u201d It already has\u2014and this distinguishes it\nfundamentally from Christianity,\u2014the self-deception of moral concepts beneath\nit,\u2014to use my own phraseology, it stands _Beyond Good and Evil._ The two\nphysiological facts upon which it rests and upon which it bestows its\nattention are: in the first place excessive irritability of feeling, which\nmanifests itself as a refined susceptibility to pain, _and also_ as super-\nspiritualisation, an all-too-lengthy sojourn amid concepts and logical\nprocedures, under the influence of which the personal instinct has suffered in\nfavour of the \u201cimpersonal.\u201d (\u2014Both of these states will be known to a few of\nmy readers, the objective ones, who, like myself, will know them from\nexperience.) Thanks to these physiological conditions, a state of depression\nset in, which Buddha sought to combat by means of hygiene. Against it, he\nprescribes life in the open, a life of travel; moderation and careful choice\nin food; caution in regard to all intoxicating liquor, as also in regard to\nall the passions which tend to create bile and to heat the blood; and he\ndeprecates care either on one\u2019s own or on other people\u2019s account He recommends\nideas that bring one either peace or good cheer,\u2014he invents means whereby the\nhabit of contrary ideas may be lost He understands goodness\u2014being good\u2014as\npromoting health. _Prayer_ is out of the question, as is also _asceticism;_\nthere is neither a Categorical Imperative nor any discipline whatsoever, even\nwithin the walls of a monastery (\u2014it is always possible to leave it if one\nwants to).

Precisely on this account he does\nnot exhort his followers to wage war upon those who do not share their views;\nnothing is more abhorred in his doctrine than the feeling of revenge, of\naversion, and of resentment (\u2014\u201cnot through hostility doth hostility end\u201d: the\ntouching refrain of the whole of Buddhism....)

The movement must\nalso originate among the higher and even learned classes. Cheerfulness, peace\nand absence of desire, are the highest of inspirations, and they are\n_realised._ Buddhism is not a religion in which perfection is merely aspired\nto: perfection is the normal case. In Christianity all the instincts of the\nsubjugated and oppressed come to the fore: it is the lowest classes who seek\ntheir salvation in this religion. Here the pastime, the manner of killing time\nis to practise the casuistry of sin, self-criticism, and conscience\ninquisition. Here the ecstasy in the presence of a _powerful being,_ called\n\u201cgod,\u201d is constantly maintained by means of prayer; while the highest thing is\nregarded as unattainable, as a gift, as an act of \u201cgrace\u201d Here plain dealing\nis also entirely lacking: concealment and the darkened room are Christian.\nHere the body is despised, hygiene is repudiated as sensual; the church\nrepudiates even cleanliness (\u2014the first Christian measure after the banishment\nof the Moors was the closing of the public baths, of which Cordova alone\npossessed 270). A certain spirit of cruelty towards one\u2019s self and others is\nalso Christian: hatred of all those who do not share one\u2019s views; the will to\npersecute Sombre and exciting ideas are in the foreground; the most coveted\nstates and those which are endowed with the finest names, are really epileptic\nin their nature; diet is selected in such a way as to favour morbid symptoms\nand to over-excite the nerves.

Here,\ndissatisfaction with one\u2019s self, suffering through one\u2019s self, is not as in\nthe case of Buddhism, excessive irritability and susceptibility to pain, but\nrather, conversely, it is an inordinate desire for inflicting pain, for a\ndischarge of the inner tension in hostile deeds and ideas. Christianity was in\nneed of _barbaric_ ideas and values, in order to be able to master barbarians:\nsuch are for instance, the sacrifice of the first-born, the drinking of blood\nat communion, the contempt of the intellect and of culture; torture in all its\nforms, sensual and non-sensual; the great pomp of the cult Buddhism is a\nreligion for _senile_ men, for races which have become kind, gentle, and over-\nspiritual, and which feel pain too easily (\u2014Europe is not nearly ripe for it\nyet\u2014); it calls them back to peace and cheerfulness, to a regimen for the\nintellect, to a certain hardening of the body. Christianity aims at mastering\n_beasts of prey_ ; its expedient is to make them _ill,_ \u2014to render feeble is\nthe Christian recipe for taming, for \u201ccivilisation.\u201d Buddhism is a religion\nfor the close and exhaustion of civilisation; Christianity does not even find\ncivilisation at hand when it appears, in certain circumstances it lays the\nfoundation of civilisation.\n\n23\n\nBuddhism, I repeat, is a hundred times colder, more truthful, more objective.\nIt no longer requires to justify pain and its susceptibility to suffering by\nthe interpretation of sin,\u2014it simply says what it thinks, \u201cI suffer.\u201d To the\nbarbarian, on the other hand, suffering in itself is not a respectable thing:\nin order to acknowledge to himself that he suffers, what he requires, in the\nfirst place, is an explanation (his instinct directs him more readily to deny\nhis suffering, or to endure it in silence). In his case, the word \u201cdevil\u201d was\na blessing: man had an almighty and terrible enemy,\u2014he had no reason to be\nashamed of suffering at the hands of such an enemy.\u2014\n\nAt bottom there are in Christianity one or two subtleties which belong to the\nOrient In the first place it knows that it is a matter of indifference whether\na thing be true or not; but that it is of the highest importance that it\nshould be believed to be true.

If for\nexample it give anyone pleasure to believe himself delivered from sin, it is\n_not_ a necessary prerequisite thereto that he should be sinful, but only that\nhe should _feel_ sinful.

Sufferers\nmust be sustained by a hope which no actuality can contradict,\u2014and which\ncannot ever be realised: the hope of another world. (Precisely on account of\nthis power that hope has of making the unhappy linger on, the Greeks regarded\nit as the evil of evils, as the most _mischievous_ evil: it remained behind in\nPandora\u2019s box.) In order that _love_ may be possible, God must be a person. In\norder that the lowest instincts may also make their voices heard God must be\nyoung. For the ardour of the women a beautiful saint, and for the ardour of\nthe men a Virgin Mary has to be pressed into the foreground. All this on\ncondition that Christianity wishes to rule over a certain soil, on which\nAphrodisiac or Adonis cults had already determined the _notion_ of a cult. To\ninsist upon _chastity_ only intensifies the vehemence and profundity of the\nreligious instinct\u2014it makes the cult warmer, more enthusiastic, more\nsoulful.\u2014Love is the state in which man sees things most widely different from\nwhat they are. The force of illusion reaches its zenith here, as likewise the\nsweetening and transfiguring power. When a man is in love he endures more than\nat other times; he submits to everything. The thing was to discover a religion\nin which it was possible to love: by this means the worst in life is\novercome\u2014it is no longer even seen.\u2014So much for three Christian virtues Faith,\nHope, and Charity: I call them the three Christian _precautionary measures._\n\u2014Buddhism is too full of aged wisdom, too positivistic to be shrewd in this\nway.\n\n\n24\n\nHere I only touch upon the problem of the origin of Christianity. The first\nprinciple of its solution reads: Christianity can be understood only in\nrelation to the soil out of which it grew,\u2014it is not a counter-movement\nagainst the Jewish instinct, it is the rational outcome of the latter, one\nstep further in its appalling logic. In the formula of the Saviour: \u201cfor\nSalvation is of the Jews.\u201d\u2014The second principle is: the psychological type of\nthe Galilean is still recognisable, but it was only in a state of utter\ndegeneration (which is at once a distortion and an overloading with foreign\nfeatures) that he was able to serve the purpose for which he has been\nused,\u2014namely, as the type of a Redeemer of mankind.\n\nThe Jews are the most remarkable people in the history of the world, because\nwhen they were confronted with the question of Being or non-Being, with simply\nuncanny deliberateness, they preferred Being _at any price:_ this price was\nthe fundamental _falsification_ of all Nature, all the naturalness and all the\nreality, of the inner quite as much as of the outer world. They hedged\nthemselves in behind all those conditions under which hitherto a people has\nbeen able to live, has been allowed to live; of themselves they created an\nidea which was the reverse of _natural_ conditions,\u2014each in turn, they twisted\nfirst religion, then the cult, then morality, history and psychology, about in\na manner so perfectly hopeless that they were made _to contradict their\nnatural value._ We meet with the same phenomena again, and exaggerated to an\nincalculable degree, although only as a copy:\u2014the Christian Church as compared\nwith the \u201cchosen people,\u201d lacks all claim to originality.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 238280, "end_char_idx": 242319, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "71f17554-a8e1-46b6-88d4-b82231543cb4": {"__data__": {"id_": "71f17554-a8e1-46b6-88d4-b82231543cb4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "52ce8356-28ca-4fd0-8eb5-1ff3aabc8a3b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ccacc582c0a976ac41dcb5ef4cb24995eba34bf63d001bc0cdd72802091e1e89", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "255066f7-af50-49e2-8181-5b2978a921b4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "854df125ab2b57ad8e8fd2753a02b6fbc1dd07207a07637ef17aac69b45fd4f5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a3cc7c41-d782-4e2b-be67-8b6b9909a406", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a7d34e042ae6aa7d5f370f60751f16832491aee922598c4a409eec6070ce836c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "They hedged\nthemselves in behind all those conditions under which hitherto a people has\nbeen able to live, has been allowed to live; of themselves they created an\nidea which was the reverse of _natural_ conditions,\u2014each in turn, they twisted\nfirst religion, then the cult, then morality, history and psychology, about in\na manner so perfectly hopeless that they were made _to contradict their\nnatural value._ We meet with the same phenomena again, and exaggerated to an\nincalculable degree, although only as a copy:\u2014the Christian Church as compared\nwith the \u201cchosen people,\u201d lacks all claim to originality. Precisely on this\naccount the Jews are the most _fatal_ people in the history of the world:\ntheir ultimate influence has falsified mankind to such an extent, that even to\nthis day the Christian can be anti-Semitic in spirit, without comprehending\nthat he himself is the _final consequence of Judaism._\n\nIt was in my \u201cGenealogy of Morals\u201d that I first gave a psychological\nexposition of the idea of the antithesis noble and _resentment-morality,_ the\nlatter having arisen out of an attitude of negation to the former: but this is\nJud\u00e6o-Christian morality heart and soul. In order to be able to say Nay to\neverything that represents the ascending movement of life, prosperity, power,\nbeauty, and self-affirmation on earth, the instinct of resentment, become\ngenius, bad to invent _another_ world, from the standpoint of which that _Yea-\nsaying_ to life appeared as _the_ most evil and most abominable thing. From\nthe psychological standpoint the Jewish people are possessed of the toughest\nvitality. Transplanted amid impossible conditions, with profound self-\npreservative intelligence, it voluntarily took the side of all the instincts\nof decadence,\u2014 _not_ as though dominated by them, but because it detected a\npower in them by means of which it could assert itself _against_ \u201cthe world.\u201d\nThe Jews are the opposite of all _decadents_ : they have been forced to\nrepresent them to the point of illusion, and with a _non plus ultra_ of\nhistrionic genius, they have known how to set themselves at the head of all\ndecadent movements (St Paul and Christianity for instance), in order to create\nsomething from them which is stronger than every party _saying Yea to life._\nFor the category of men which aspires to power in Judaism and\nChristianity,\u2014that is to say, for the sacerdotal class, decadence is but a\n_means;_ this category of men has a vital interest in making men sick, and in\nturning the notions \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad,\u201d \u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cfalse,\u201d upside down in a\nmanner which is not only dangerous to life, but also slanders it.\n\n25\n\nThe history of Israel is invaluable as the typical history of every\n_denaturalization_ of natural values: let me point to five facts which relate\nthereto. Originally, and above all in the period of the kings, even Israel\u2019s\nattitude to all things was the _right_ one \u2014that is to say, the natural one.\nIts Jehovah was the expression of its consciousness of power, of its joy over\nitself, of its hope for itself: victory and salvation were expected from him,\nthrough him it was confident that Nature would give what a people\nrequires\u2014above all rain. Jehovah is the God of Israel, and _consequently_ the\nGod of justice: this is the reasoning of every people which is in the position\nof power, and which has a good conscience in that position. In the solemn cult\nboth sides of this self-affirmation of a people find expression: it is\ngrateful for the great strokes of fate by means of which it became uppermost;\nit is grateful for the regularity in the succession of the seasons and for all\ngood fortune in the rearing of cattle and in the tilling of the soil.\u2014This\nstate of affairs remained the ideal for some considerable time, even after it\nhad been swept away in a deplorable manner by anarchy from within and the\nAssyrians from without But the people still retained, as their highest\ndesideratum, that vision of a king who was a good soldier and a severe judge;\nand he who retained it most of all was that typical prophet (\u2014that is to say,\ncritic and satirist of the age), Isaiah.\u2014But all hopes remained unrealised.\nThe old God was no longer able to do what he had done formerly. He ought to\nhave been dropped.

We would feel this\nshameful act of historical falsification far more poignantly if the\necclesiastical interpretation of history through millenniums had not blunted\nalmost all our sense for the demands of uprightness _in historicis._ And the\nchurch is seconded by the philosophers: _the_ of \u201ca moral order of the\nuniverse\u201d permeates the whole development even of more modern philosophy. What\ndoes a \u201cmoral order of the universe\u201d mean? That once and for all there is such\na thing as a will of God which determines what man has to do and what he has\nto leave undone; that the value of a people or of an individual is measured\naccording to how much or how little the one or the other obeys the will of\nGod; that in the destinies of a people or of an individual, the will of God\nshows itself dominant, that is to say it punishes or rewards according to the\ndegree of obedience. In the place of this miserable falsehood, _reality_ says:\na parasitical type of man, who can flourish only at the cost of all the\nhealthy elements of life, the priest abuses the name of God: he calls that\nstate of affairs in which the priest determines the value of things \u201cthe\nKingdom of God\u201d; he calls the means whereby such a state of affairs is\nattained or maintained, \u201cthe Will of God\u201d; with cold-blooded cynicism he\nmeasures peoples, ages and individuals according to whether they favour or\noppose the ascendancy of the priesthood.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 245863, "end_char_idx": 249575, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c17e16fd-92bc-48cc-82ec-8b3a52f73cd2": {"__data__": {"id_": "c17e16fd-92bc-48cc-82ec-8b3a52f73cd2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "52ce8356-28ca-4fd0-8eb5-1ff3aabc8a3b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ccacc582c0a976ac41dcb5ef4cb24995eba34bf63d001bc0cdd72802091e1e89", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a3cc7c41-d782-4e2b-be67-8b6b9909a406", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "237289ce2b986ce664d4f3ea060a065cc9ab625e17f48bfd1ba62766dee7290d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ce964369-5633-4b8b-b84c-ce1faf8d37d3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c6e56e5a82192320c6e2fc1e14a0e312c3c1a0c0c59a877b5123b8466acb3fd7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In the place of this miserable falsehood, _reality_ says:\na parasitical type of man, who can flourish only at the cost of all the\nhealthy elements of life, the priest abuses the name of God: he calls that\nstate of affairs in which the priest determines the value of things \u201cthe\nKingdom of God\u201d; he calls the means whereby such a state of affairs is\nattained or maintained, \u201cthe Will of God\u201d; with cold-blooded cynicism he\nmeasures peoples, ages and individuals according to whether they favour or\noppose the ascendancy of the priesthood.

For this should be understood: every\nnatural custom, every natural institution (the State, the administration of\njustice, marriage, the care of the sick and the poor), every demand inspired\nby the instinct of life, in short everything that has a value in itself, is\nrendered absolutely worthless and even dangerous through the parasitism of the\npriest (or of the \u201cmoral order of the universe\u201d): a sanction after the fact is\nrequired,\u2014a _power which imparts value_ is necessary, which in so doing says,\nNay to nature, and which by this means alone _creates_ a valuation....

This saintly\nanarchist who called the lowest of the low, the outcasts and \u201csinners,\u201d the\nChandala of Judaism, to revolt against the established order of things (and in\nlanguage which, if the gospels are to be trusted, would get one sent to\nSiberia even to-day)\u2014this man was a political criminal in so far as political\ncriminals were possible in a community so absurdly non-political.

M. Renan, that buffoon _in psychologies,_ has contributed the two\nmost monstrous ideas imaginable to the explanation of the type of Jesus: the\nidea of the _genius_ and the idea of the _hero_ (\u201c _h\u00e9ros_ \u201d). But if there is\nanything thoroughly unevangelical surely it is the idea of the hero. It is\nprecisely the reverse of all struggle, of all consciousness of taking part in\nthe fight, that has become instinctive here: the inability to resist is here\nconverted into a morality (\u201cresist not evil,\u201d the profoundest sentence in the\nwhole of the gospels, their key in a certain sense), the blessedness of peace,\nof gentleness, of not _being able_ to be an enemy. What is the meaning of\n\u201cglad tidings\u201d?\u2014True life, eternal life has been found\u2014it is not promised, it\nis actually here, it is in _you;_ it is life in love, in love free from all\nselection or exclusion, free from all distance. Everybody is the child of\nGod\u2014Jesus does not by any means claim anything for himself alone,\u2014as the child\nof God everybody is equal to everybody else.... Fancy making Jesus a _hero!_\n\u2014And what a tremendous misunderstanding the word \u201cgenius\u201d is! Our whole idea\nof \u201cspirit,\u201d which is a civilised idea, could have had no meaning whatever in\nthe world in which Jesus lived. In the strict terms of the physiologist, a\nvery different word ought to be used here.... We know of a condition of morbid\nirritability of the sense of _touch,_ which recoils shuddering from every kind\nof contact, and from every attempt at grasping a solid object. Any such\nphysiological _habitus_ reduced to its ultimate logical conclusion, becomes an\ninstinctive hatred of all reality, a flight into the \u201cintangible,\u201d into the\n\u201cincomprehensible\u201d; a repugnance to all formul\u00e6, to every notion of time and\nspace, to everything that is established such as customs, institutions, the\nchurch; a feeling at one\u2019s ease in a world in which no sign of reality is any\nlonger visible, a merely \u201cinner\u201d world, a \u201ctrue\u201d world, an \u201ceternal\u201d world....\n\u201cThe Kingdom of God is within you\u201d...\n\n30\n\n_The instinctive hatred of reality_ is the outcome of an extreme\nsusceptibility to pain and to irritation, which can no longer endure to be\n\u201ctouched\u201d at all, because every sensation strikes too deep.\n\n_The instinctive exclusion of all aversion, of all hostility, of all\nboundaries and distances in feeling,_ is the outcome of an extreme\nsusceptibility to pain and to irritation, which regards all resistance, all\ncompulsory resistance as insufferable _anguish_(\u2014that is to say, as harmful,\nas _deprecated_ by the self-preservative instinct), and which knows\nblessedness (happiness) only when it is no longer obliged to offer resistance\nto anybody, either evil or detrimental,\u2014love as the Only ultimate possibility\nof life....\n\nThese are the two _physiological realities_ upon which and out of which the\ndoctrine of salvation has grown.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 256257, "end_char_idx": 260248, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dcc9062b-ec43-4bc6-9457-b6ad6c1497dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "dcc9062b-ec43-4bc6-9457-b6ad6c1497dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "52ce8356-28ca-4fd0-8eb5-1ff3aabc8a3b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ccacc582c0a976ac41dcb5ef4cb24995eba34bf63d001bc0cdd72802091e1e89", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "debea30a-b332-411e-8318-7f5ee853455a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "cad86d0125f9a18f4b7c800608a2e6b5eca1f5e801939f2b8653a259c4434a5b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1942ab5f-a553-4489-87cf-9b87cc7f7d47", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fc10c5d7d9e6e7a5960f0df571c35e1884dc149c152723ade0b35678f123cb4e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "_The instinctive exclusion of all aversion, of all hostility, of all\nboundaries and distances in feeling,_ is the outcome of an extreme\nsusceptibility to pain and to irritation, which regards all resistance, all\ncompulsory resistance as insufferable _anguish_(\u2014that is to say, as harmful,\nas _deprecated_ by the self-preservative instinct), and which knows\nblessedness (happiness) only when it is no longer obliged to offer resistance\nto anybody, either evil or detrimental,\u2014love as the Only ultimate possibility\nof life....\n\nThese are the two _physiological realities_ upon which and out of which the\ndoctrine of salvation has grown. I call them a sublime further development of\nhedonism, upon a thoroughly morbid soil. Epicureanism, the pagan theory of\nsalvation, even though it possessed a large proportion of Greek vitality and\nnervous energy, remains the most closely related to the above. Epicurus was a\n_typical_ decadent: and I was the first to recognise him as such.\u2014The terror\nof pain, even of infinitely slight pain\u2014such a state cannot possibly help\nculminating in a _religion_ of love....\n\n31\n\nI have given my reply to the problem in advance. The prerequisite thereto was\nthe admission of the fact that the type of the Saviour has reached us only in\na very distorted form. This distortion in itself is extremely feasible: for\nmany reasons a type of that kind could not be pure, whole, and free from\nadditions. The environment in which this strange figure moved, must have left\nits mark upon him, and the history, the _destiny_ of the first Christian\ncommunities must have done so to a still greater degree. Thanks to that\ndestiny, the type must have been enriched retrospectively with features which\ncan be interpreted only as serving the purposes of war and of propaganda That\nstrange and morbid world into which the gospels lead us\u2014a world which seems to\nhave been drawn from a Russian novel, where the scum and dross of society,\ndiseases of the nerves and \u201cchildish\u201d imbecility seem to have given each other\nrendezvous\u2014must in any case have _coarsened_ the type: the first disciples\nespecially must have translated an existence conceived entirely in symbols and\nabstractions into their own crudities, in order at least to be able to\nunderstand something about it,\u2014for them the type existed only after it had\nbeen cast in a more familiar mould.... The prophet, the Messiah, the future\njudge, the teacher of morals, the thaumaturgist, John the Baptist\u2014all these\nwere but so many opportunities of misunderstanding the type.... Finally, let\nus not under-rate the _proprium_ of all great and especially sectarian\nveneration: very often it effaces from the venerated object, all the original\nand frequently painfully un-familiar traits and idiosyncrasies\u2014 _it does not\neven see them._ It is greatly to be deplored that no Dostoiewsky lived in the\nneighbourhood of this most interesting decadent,\u2014I mean someone who would have\nknown how to feel the poignant charm of such a mixture of the sublime, the\nmorbid, and the childlike. Finally, the type, as an example of decadence, may\nactually have been extraordinarily multifarious and contradictory: this, as a\npossible alternative, is not to be altogether ignored. Albeit, everything\nseems to point away from it; for, precisely in this case, tradition would\nnecessarily have been particularly true and objective: whereas we have reasons\nfor assuming the reverse. Meanwhile a yawning chasm of contradiction separates\nthe mountain, lake, and pastoral preacher, who strikes us as a Buddha on a\nsoil only very slightly Hindu, from that combative fanatic, the mortal enemy\nof theologians and priests, whom Renan\u2019s malice has glorified as \u201c _le grand\nma\u00eetre en ironie._ \u201d For my part, I do not doubt but what the greater part of\nthis venom (and even of _esprit_) was inoculated into the type of the Master\nonly as the outcome of the agitated condition of Christian propaganda.

The \u201cglad tidings\u201d are simply that there are no longer any\ncontradictions, that the Kingdom of Heaven is for the _children;_ the faith\nwhich raises its voice here is not a faith that has been won by a struggle,\u2014it\nis to hand, it was there from the beginning, it is a sort of spiritual return\nto childishness. The case of delayed and undeveloped puberty in the organism,\nas the result of degeneration is at least familiar to physiologists. A faith\nof this sort does not show anger, it does not blame, neither does it defend\nitself: it does not bring \u201cthe sword,\u201d\u2014it has no inkling of how it will one\nday establish feuds between man and man. It does not demonstrate itself,\neither by miracles, or by reward and promises, or yet \u201cthrough the\nscriptures\u201d: it is in itself at every moment its own miracle, its own reward,\nits own proof, its own \u201cKingdom of God.\u201d This faith cannot be formulated\u2014it\nlives, it guards against formulas. The accident of environment, of speech, of\npreparatory culture, certainly determines a particular series of conceptions:\nearly Christianity deals only in Jud\u00e6o-Semitic conceptions (\u2014the eating and\ndrinking at the last supper form part of these,\u2014this idea which like\neverything Jewish has been abused so maliciously by the church). But one\nshould guard against seeing anything more than a language of signs, semiotics,\nan opportunity for parables in all this. The very fact that no word is to be\ntaken literally, is the only condition on which this Anti-realist is able to\nspeak at all. Among Indians he would have made use of the ideas of Sankhyara,\namong Chinese, those of Lao-tze\u2014and would not have been aware of any\ndifference. With a little terminological laxity Jesus might be called a \u201cfree\nspirit\u201d\u2014he cares not a jot for anything that is established: the word\n_killeth,_ everything fixed _killtth._ The idea, _experience,_ \u201clife\u201d as he\nalone knows it, is, according to him, opposed to every kind of word, formula,\nlaw, faith and dogma. He speaks only of the innermost things: \u201clife\u201d or\n\u201ctruth,\u201d or \u201clight,\u201d is his expression for the innermost thing,\u2014everything\nelse, the whole of reality, the whole of nature, language even, has only the\nvalue of a sign, of a simile for him.\u2014It is of paramount importance not to\nmake any mistake at this point, however great may be the temptation thereto\nthat lies in Christian\u2014I mean to say, ecclesiastical prejudice.

The\n\u201cgospel\u201d _died_ on the cross.

To this day a life of this kind is\nstill possible; for certain men, it is even necessary: genuine, primitive\nChristianity will be possible in all ages.... _Not_ a faith, but a course of\naction, above all a course of inaction, non-interference, and a different\nlife.... States of consciousness, any sort of faith, a holding of certain\nthings for true, as every psychologist knows, are indeed of absolutely no\nconsequence, and are only of fifth-rate importance compared with the value of\nthe instincts: more exactly, the whole concept of intellectual causality is\nfalse. To reduce the fact of being a Christian, or of Christianity, to a\nholding of something for true, to a mere phenomenon of consciousness, is\ntantamount to denying Christianity. _In fact there have never been any\nChristians._ The \u201cChristian,\u201d he who for two thousand years has been called a\nChristian, is merely a psychological misunderstanding of self.

That\nhere, even _in psychologicis_ , error is fundamental,\u2014that is to say capable\nof determining the spirit of things,\u2014that is to say, _substance._ Take one\nidea away from the whole, and put one realistic fact in its stead,\u2014and the\nwhole of Christianity tumbles into nonentity!\u2014Surveyed from above, this\nstrangest of all facts,-a religion not only dependent upon error, but\ninventive and showing signs of genius only in those errors which are dangerous\nand which poison life and the human heart\u2014remains a _spectacle for gods,_ for\nthose gods who are at the same time philosophers and whom I met for instance\nin those celebrated dialogues on the island of Naxos. At the moment when they\nget rid of their _loathing (\u2014and we do as well!_), they will be thankful for\nthe spectacle the Christians have offered: the wretched little planet called\nEarth perhaps deserves on account of _this_ curious case alone, a divine\nglance, and divine interest.... Let us not therefore underestimate the\nChristians: the Christian, false _to the point of innocence in falsity,_ is\nfar above the apes,\u2014in regard to the Christians a certain well-known theory of\nDescent becomes a mere good-natured compliment.\n\n40\n\n\u2014The fate of the gospel was decided at the moment of the death,\u2014it hung on the\n\u201ccross.\u201d ... It was only death, this unexpected and ignominious death; it was\nonly the cross which as a rule was reserved simply for the _canaille,_ \u2014only\nthis appalling paradox which confronted the disciples with the actual riddle:\n_Who was that? what was that?_ \u2014The state produced by the excited and\nprofoundly wounded feelings of these men, the suspicion that such a death\nmight imply the _refutation_ of their cause, and the terrible note of\ninterrogation: \u201cwhy precisely thus?\u201d will be understood only too well. In this\ncase everything _must_ be necessary, everything must have meaning, a reason,\nthe highest reason. The love of a disciple admits of no such thing as\naccident. Only then did the chasm yawn: \u201cwho has killed him?\u201d \u201cwho was his\nnatural enemy?\u201d\u2014this question rent the firmament like a flash of lightning.\nReply: _dominant_ Judaism, its ruling class. Thenceforward the disciple felt\nhimself in revolt _against_ established order; he understood Jesus, after the\nfact, as one in _revolt against established order._ Heretofore this warlike,\nthis nay-saying and nay-doing feature in Christ had been lacking; nay more, he\nwas its contradiction. The small primitive community had obviously understood\n_nothing_ of the principal factor of all, which was the example of freedom and\nof superiority to every form of _resentment_ which lay in this way of dying.\nAnd this shows how little they understood him altogether! At bottom Jesus\ncould not have desired anything else by his death than to give the strongest\npublic _example_ and _proof_ of his doctrine.... But his disciples were very\nfar from _forgiving this_ death\u2014though if they had done so it would have been\nin the highest sense evangelical on their part,\u2014neither were they prepared,\nwith a gentle and serene calmness of heart, to _offer_ themselves for a\nsimilar death....

Alas! how\nprompt and sudden was the end of the gospel! Expiatory sacrifice for guilt,\nand indeed in its most repulsive and barbaric form,\u2014the sacrifice of the\n_innocent_ for the sins of the guilty! What appalling Paganism!\u2014For Jesus\nhimself had done away with the concept \u201cguilt,\u201d\u2014he denied any gulf between God\nand man, he _lived_ this unity between God and man, it was this that\nconstituted _his_ \u201cglad tidings.\u201d ... And he did _not_ teach it as a\nprivilege!\u2014Thenceforward there was gradually imported into the type of the\nSaviour the doctrine of the Last Judgment, and of the \u201csecond coming,\u201d the\ndoctrine of sacrificial death, and the doctrine of _Resurrection,_ by means of\nwhich the whole concept \u201cblessedness,\u201d the entire and only reality of the\ngospel, is conjured away\u2014in favour of a state _after_ death!...

Paul is\nthe incarnation of a type which is the reverse of that of the Saviour; he is\nthe genius in hatred, in the standpoint of hatred, and in the relentless logic\nof hatred. And alas what did this dysangelist not sacrifice to his hatred!\nAbove all the Saviour himself: he nailed him to _his_ cross. Christ\u2019s life,\nhis example, his doctrine and death, the sense and the right of the gospel\u2014not\na vestige of alt this was left, once this forger, prompted by his hatred, had\nunderstood in it only that which could serve his purpose. _Not_ reality: _not_\nhistorical truth! ... And once more, the sacerdotal instinct of the Jew,\nperpetrated the same great crime against history,\u2014he simply cancelled the\nyesterday, and the day before that, out of Christianity; he _contrived of his\nown accord a history of the birth of Christianity._ He did more: he once more\nfalsified the history of Israel, so as to make it appear as a prologue to\n_his_ mission: all the prophets had referred to _his_ \u201cSaviour.\u201d ... Later on\nthe Church even distorted the history of mankind so as to convert it into a\nprelude to Christianity.... The type of the Saviour, his teaching, his life,\nhis death, the meaning of his death, even the sequel to his death\u2014nothing\nremained untouched, nothing was left which even remotely resembled reality. St\nPaul simply transferred the centre of gravity of the whole of that great life,\nto a place _behind_ this life,\u2014in the _lie_ of the \u201cresuscitated\u201d Christ. At\nbottom, he had no possible use for the life of the Saviour,\u2014he needed the\ndeath on the cross, _and_ something more. To regard as honest a man like St\nPaul (a man whose home was the very headquarters of Stoical enlightenment)\nwhen he devises a proof of the continued existence of the Saviour out of a\nhallucination; or even to believe him when he declares that he had this\nhallucination, would amount to foolishness on the part of a psychologist: St\nPaul desired the end, consequently he also desired the means.... Even what he\nhimself did not believe, was believed in by the idiots among whom he spread\n_his_ doctrine.\u2014What he wanted was power; with St Paul the priest again\naspired to power,\u2014he could make use only of concepts, doctrines, symbols with\nwhich masses may be tyrannised over, and with which herds are formed. What was\nthe only part of Christianity which was subsequently borrowed by Muhamed? St\nPaul\u2019s invention, his expedient for priestly tyranny and to the formation of\nherds: the belief in immortality\u2014 _that is to say, the doctrine of the \u201cLast\nJudgment.\u201d ..._\n\n43\n\nWhen the centre of gravity of life is laid, _not_ in life, but in a beyond\u2014\n_in nonentity,_ \u2014life is utterly robbed of its balance.

The \u201csalvation of the soul\u201d\u2014in plain English: \u201cthe world revolves\naround me\u201d ... The poison of the doctrine \u201c _equal_ rights for all\u201d\u2014has been\ndispensed with the greatest thoroughness by Christianity: Christianity,\nprompted by the most secret recesses of bad instincts, has waged a deadly war\nupon all feeling of reverence and distance between man and man\u2014that is to say,\nthe _prerequisite_ of all elevation, of every growth in culture; out of the\nresentment of the masses it wrought its _principal weapons_ against us,\nagainst everything noble, joyful, exalted on earth, against our happiness on\nearth.... To grant \u201cimmortality\u201d to every St Peter and St Paul, was the\ngreatest, the most vicious outrage upon _noble_ humanity that has ever been\nperpetrated.\u2014And do not let us underestimate the fatal influence which,\nspringing from Christianity, has insinuated itself even into politics!\nNowadays no one has the courage of special rights, of rights of t dominion, of\na feeling of self-respect and of respect for his equals,\u2014of _pathos of\ndistance._ Our politics are diseased with this lack of courage!\u2014The\naristocratic attitude of mind has been most thoroughly undermined by the lie\nof the equality of souls; and if the belief in the \u201cprivilege of the greatest\nnumber\u201d creates and will continue _to create revolutions,_ \u2014it is\nChristianity, let there be no doubt about it, and Christian values, which\nconvert every revolution into blood and crime!

They simply\nsmell bad.\u2014In vain have I sought for a single sympathetic feature in the New\nTestament; there is not a trace of freedom, kindliness, open-heartedness and\nhonesty to be found in it. Humaneness has not even made a start in this book,\nwhile _cleanly_ instincts are entirely absent from it.... Only evil instincts\nare to be found in the New Testament, it shows no sign of courage, these\npeople lack even the courage of their evil instincts. All is cowardice, all is\na closing of one\u2019s eyes and self-deception. Every book becomes clean, after\none has just read the New Testament: for instance, immediately after laying\ndown St Paul, I read with particular delight that most charming and most\nwanton of scoffers, Petronius, of whom someone might say what Domenico\nBoccaccio wrote to the Duke of Parma about C\u00e6sar Borgia: \u201c _\u00e8 tutto festo_\n\u201d\u2014immortally healthy, immortally cheerful and well-constituted. ... These\npetty bigots err in their calculations and in the most important thing of all.\nThey certainly attack; but everything they assail is, by that very fact alone,\n_distinguished._ He whom a \u201cprimitive Christian\u201d attacks, is _not_ thereby\nsullied.... Conversely it is an honour to be opposed by \u201cprimitive\nChristians.\u201d One cannot read the New Testament without feeling a preference\nfor everything in it which is the subject of abuse\u2014not to speak of the \u201cwisdom\nof this world,\u201d which an impudent windbag tries in vain to confound \u201cby the\nfoolishness of preaching.\u201d Even the Pharisees and the Scribes derive advantage\nfrom such opposition: they must certainly have been worth something in order\nto have been hated in such a disreputable way. Hypocrisy\u2014as if this were a\nreproach which the \u201cfirst Christians\u201d _were at liberty_ to make!\u2014After all the\nScribes and Pharisees were the _privileged ones;_ this was quite enough, the\nhatred of the Chandala requires no other reasons. I very much fear that the\n\u201cfirst Christian\u201d\u2014as also the \u201c _last Christian\u201d whom I may yet be able to\nmeet,\u2014_ is in his deepest instincts a rebel against everything privileged; he\nlives and struggles unremittingly for \u201cequal rights\u201d!... Regarded more\nclosely, he has no alternative.... If one\u2019s desire be personally to represent\n\u201cone of the chosen of God\u201d\u2014or a \u201ctemple of God,\u201d or \u201ca judge of angels,\u201d\u2014then\nevery _other_ principle of selection, for instance that based upon a standard\nof honesty, intellect, manliness and pride, or upon beauty and freedom of\nheart, becomes the \u201cworld,\u201d\u2014 _evil in itself._ Moral: every word on the lips\nof a \u201cfirst Christian\u201d is a lie, every action he does is an instinctive\nfalsehood,\u2014all his values, all his aims are pernicious; but the man he, hates,\n_the thing_ he hates, _has value._ ... The Christian, more particularly the\nChristian priest, is a _criterion of values_ \u2014Do I require to add that in the\nwhole of the New Testament only _one_ figure appears which we cannot help\nrespecting?

But\nhow prove _that_ that which the priest promises to the faithful really will\ntake place, to wit: the \u201cBeyond\u201d which defies all demonstration?\u2014The assumed\n\u201cproof of power\u201d is at bottom once again only a belief in the fact that the\neffect which faith promises will not fail to take place.

Christianity is in _need_ of illness,\njust as Ancient Greece was in need of a superabundance of health. The actual\nulterior motive of the whole of the Church\u2019s system of salvation is to _make\npeople ill._ And is not the Church itself the Catholic madhouse as an ultimate\nideal?\u2014The earth as a whole converted into a madhouse?\u2014The kind of religious\nman which the Church aims at producing is a typical _decadent_ The moment of\ntime at which a religious crisis attains the ascendancy over a people, is\nalways characterised by nerve-epidemics; the \u201cinner world\u201d of the religious\nman is ridiculously like the \u201cinner world\u201d of over-irritable and exhausted\npeople; the \u201chighest\u201d states which Christianity holds up to mankind as the\nvalue of values, are epileptic in character,\u2014the Church has pronounced only\nmadmen _or_ great swindlers _in majorem dei honorem_ holy.

At the time when the morbid and\ncorrupted Chandala classes became Christianised in the whole of the\n_imperium,_ the very _contrary type,_ nobility, was extant in its finest and\nmaturest forms. The greatest number became master; the democracy of Christian\ninstincts triumphed.... Christianity was not \u201cnational,\u201d it was not determined\nby race,\u2014it appealed to all the disinherited forms of life, it had its allies\neverywhere. Christianity is built upon the rancour of the sick; its instinct\nis directed _against_ the sound, against health. Everything well-constituted,\nproud, high-spirited, and beautiful is offensive to its ears and eyes. Again I\nremind you of St Paul\u2019s priceless words: \u201cAnd God hath chosen the _weak_\nthings of the world, the _foolish_ things of the world; and _base_ things of\nthe world, and things which are _despised\u201d_ : this was the formula, _in hoc\nsigno_ decadence triumphed.\u2014 _God on the Cross_ \u2014does no one yet understand\nthe terrible ulterior motive of this symbol?\u2014Everything that suffers,\neverything that hangs on the cross, is _divine...._ All of us hang on the\ncross, consequently we are _divine ..._. We alone are divine.... Christianity\nwas a victory; a _nobler_ type of character perished through it,\u2014Christianity\nhas been humanity\u2019s greatest misfortune hitherto.\u2014\u2014\n\n52\n\nChristianity also stands opposed to everything happily constituted in the\n_mind,_ \u2014it can make use only of morbid reason as Christian reason; it takes\nthe side of everything idiotic, it utters a curse upon \u201cintellect,\u201d upon the\n_superbia_ of the healthy intellect. Since illness belongs to the essence of\nChristianity, the typically Christian state, \u201cfaith,\u201d _must_ also be a form of\nillness, and all straight, honest and scientific roads to knowledge must be\nrepudiated by the Church as forbidden.... Doubt in itself is already a sin....\nThe total lack of psychological cleanliness in the priest, which reveals\nitself in his look, is a _result_ of decadence. Hysterical women, as also\nchildren with scrofulous constitutions, should be observed as a proof of how\ninvariably instinctive falsity, the love of lying for the sake of lying, and\nthe in ability either to look or to walk straight, are the expression of\ndecadence. \u201cFaith\u201d simply means the refusal to know what is true.

However small an amount of loving piety we\nmight possess, a god who cured us in time of a cold in the nose, or who\narranged for us to enter a carriage just at the moment when a cloud burst over\nour heads, would be such an absurd God, that he would have to be abolished,\neven if he existed.[[9]](1418498124915300953_52263-h-6.htm.html#Footnote_9_25)\nGod as a domestic servant, as a postman, as a general provider,\u2014in short,\nmerely a word for the most foolish kind of accidents.... \u201cDivine Providence,\u201d\nas it is believed in to-day by almost every third man in \u201ccultured Germany,\u201d\nwould be an argument against God, in fact it would be the strongest argument\nagainst God that could be Imagined.

Conviction as a _means:_ much is achieved merely by means of\na conviction. Great passion makes use of and consumes convictions, it does not\nsubmit to them\u2014it knows that it is a sovereign power.

What? might\nnot falsehood be the embryonic form of conviction?\u2014At times all that is\nrequired is a change of personality: very often what was a lie in the father\nbecomes a conviction in the son.\u2014I call a lie, to refuse to see something that\none sees, to refuse to see it exactly _as_ one sees it: whether a lie is\nperpetrated before witnesses or not is beside the point.\u2014The most common sort\nof lie is the one uttered to one\u2019s self; to lie to others is relatively\nexceptional. Now this refusal to see what one sees, this refusal to see a\nthing exactly as one sees it, is almost the first condition for all those who\nbelong to a _party_ in any sense whatsoever: the man who belongs to a party\nperforce becomes a liar. German historians, for instance, are convinced that\nRome stood for despotism, whereas the Teutons introduced the spirit of freedom\ninto the world: what difference is there between this conviction and a lie?\nAfter this is it to be wondered at, that all parties, including German\nhistorians, instinctively adopt the grandiloquent phraseology of\nmorality,\u2014that morality almost owes its _survival_ to the fact that the man\nwho belongs to a party, no matter what it may be, is in need of morality every\nmoment?\u2014\u201cThis is our conviction: we confess it to the whole world, we live and\ndie for it,\u2014let us respect every thing that has a conviction!\u201d\u2014I have actually\nheard antisemites speak in this way. On the contrary, my dear sirs! An\nantisemite does not become the least bit more respectable because he lies on\nprinciple.... Priests, who in such matters are more subtle, and who perfectly\nunderstand the objection to which the idea of a conviction lies open\u2014that is\nto say of a falsehood which is perpetrated on principle _because_ it serves a\npurpose, borrowed from the Jews the prudent measure of setting the concept\n\u201cGod,\u201d \u201cWill of God,\u201d \u201cRevelation of God,\u201d at this place. Kant, too, with his\ncategorical imperative, was on the same road: this was his _practical_\nreason.\u2014There are some questions in which it is _not_ given to man to decide\nbetween true and false; all the principal questions, all the principal\nproblems of value, stand beyond human reason.... To comprehend the limits of\nreason\u2014this alone is genuine philosophy. For what purpose did God give man\nrevelation? Would God have done anything superfluous? Man cannot of his own\naccord know what is good and what is evil, that is why God taught man his\nwill.... Moral: the priest does _not_ lie, such questions as \u201ctruth\u201d or\n\u201cfalseness\u201d have nothing to do with the things concerning which the priest\nspeaks; such things do not allow of lying.

You will guess immediately why:\nit has a genuine philosophy behind it, _in_ it, not merely an evil-smelling\nJewish distillation of Rabbinism and superstition,\u2014it gives something to chew\neven to the most fastidious psychologist. And, _not_ to forget the most\nimportant point of all, it is fundamentally different from every kind of\nBible: by means of it the _noble classes,_ the philosophers and the warriors\nguard and guide the masses; it is replete with noble values, it is filled with\na feeling of perfection, with a saying of yea to life, and a triumphant sense\nof well-being in regard to itself and to life,\u2014the sun shines upon the whole\nbook.\u2014All those things which Christianity smothers with its bottomless\nvulgarity: procreation, woman, marriage, are here treated with earnestness,\nwith revere nee, with love and confidence.

The\nprerequisite for a codification of this kind, is the recognition of the fact\nthat the means which procure authority for a _truth_ to which it has cost both\ntime and great pains to attain, are fundamentally different from those with\nwhich that same truth would be proved. A law-book never relates the utility,\nthe reasons, the preliminary casuistry, of a law: for it would be precisely in\nthis way that it would forfeit its imperative tone, the \u201cthou shalt,\u201d the\nfirst condition of its being obeyed. The problem lies exactly in this.\u2014At a\ncertain stage in the development of a people, the most far-seeing class within\nit (that is to say, the class that sees farthest backwards and forwards),\ndeclares the experience of how its fellow-creatures ought to live\u2014 _can_\nlive\u2014to be finally settled. Its object is, to reap as rich and as complete a\nharvest as possible, in return for the ages of experiment and _terrible_\nexperience it has traversed. Consequently, that which has to be avoided, above\nall, is any further experimentation, the continuation of the state when values\nare still fluid, the testing, choosing, and criticising of values _in\ninfinitum._ Against all this a double wall is built up: in the first place,\n_Revelation,_ which is the assumption that the rationale of every law is not\nhuman in its origin, that it was not sought and found after ages of error, but\nthat it is divine in its origin, completely and utterly without a history,\ngift, a miracle, a mere communication.... And secondly, _tradition,_ which is\nthe assumption that the law has obtained since the most primeval times, that\nit is impious and a crime against one\u2019s ancestors to attempt to doubt it. The\nauthority of law is established on the principles: God _gave_ it, the\nancestors _lived_ it.\u2014The superior reason of such a procedure lies in the\nintention to draw consciousness off step by step from that mode of life which\nhas been recognised as correct (_i.e., proved_ after enormous and carefully\nexamined experience), so that perfect automatism of the instincts may be\nattained,\u2014this being the only possible basis of all mastery of every kind of\nperfection in the Art of Life. To draw up a law-book like Manu\u2019s, is\ntantamount to granting a people mastership for the future, perfection for the\nfuture,\u2014the right to aspire to the highest Art of Life. _To that end it must\nbe made unconscious;_ this is the object of every holy lie.\u2014 _The order of\ncastes,_ the highest, the dominating law, is only the sanction of a _natural\norder,_ of a natural legislation of the first rank, over which no arbitrary\ninnovation, no \u201cmodern idea\u201d has any power.

Whereas we have just seen a religious legislation, whose object\nwas to render the highest possible means of making life _flourish,_ and of\nmaking a grand organisation of society, eternal,\u2014Christianity found its\nmission in putting an end to such an organisation, _precisely because life\nflourishes through it._ In the one case, the net profit to the credit of\nreason, acquired through long ages of experiment and of insecurity, is applied\nusefully to the most remote ends, and the harvest, which is as large, as rich\nand as complete as possible, is reaped and garnered: in the other case, on the\ncontrary, the harvest is _blighted_ in a single night That which stood there,\n_\u00e6re perennius,_ the _imperium Romanum,_ the most magnificent form of\norganisation, under difficult conditions, that has ever been achieved, and\ncompared with which everything that preceded, and everything which followed\nit, is mere patchwork, gimcrackery, and dilettantism,\u2014those holy anarchists\nmade it their \u201cpiety,\u201d to destroy \u201cthe world\u201d\u2014that is to say, the _imperium\nRomanum,_ until no two stones were left standing one on the other,\u2014until even\nthe Teutons and other clodhoppers were able to become master of it The\nChristian and the anarchist are both decadents; they are both incapable of\nacting in any other way than disintegratingly, poisonously and witheringly,\nlike _blood-suckers;_ they are both actuated by an instinct of _mortal hatred_\nof everything that stands erect, that is great, that is lasting, and that is a\nguarantee of the future.... Christianity was the vampire of the _imperium\nRomanum,_ \u2014in a night it shattered the stupendous achievement of the Romans,\nwhich was to acquire the territory for a vast civilisation which could _bide\nits time._ \u2014Does no one understand this yet?", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 345132, "end_char_idx": 349239, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "89b19f50-b816-4369-a446-d2f1885c7b73": {"__data__": {"id_": "89b19f50-b816-4369-a446-d2f1885c7b73", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "52ce8356-28ca-4fd0-8eb5-1ff3aabc8a3b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ccacc582c0a976ac41dcb5ef4cb24995eba34bf63d001bc0cdd72802091e1e89", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "40a77656-0e64-4479-843d-df39577c8c6d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "33fbd4a07b89ce37becb8a4dc0b0aab2f8d68b52607fa28a091843a53c4ce09b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7346467f-e9a4-41fb-866e-3279ed63bde6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "085630fd07a88c1817f94874e0b4ba0fd4e6e781df13df65c617701a3b0c6a3c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The _imperium Romanum_ that we\nknow, and which the history of the Roman province teaches us to know ever more\nthoroughly, this most admirable work of art on a grand scale, was the\nbeginning, its construction was calculated _to prove_ its worth by\nmillenniums,\u2014unto this day nothing has ever again been built in this fashion,\nnor have men even dreamt since of building on this scale _sub specie aterni!_\n\u2014This organisation was sufficiently firm to withstand bad emperors: the\naccident of personalities must have nothing to do with such matters\u2014the\n_first_ principle of all great architecture.

In\nvain\u2014this has always been the achievement of the Germans.\u2014The Reformation,\nLeibniz, Kant and so-called German philosophy, the Wars of Liberation, the\nEmpire\u2014in each case are in vain for something which had already existed, for\nsomething which _cannot be recovered._ ... I confess it, these Germans are my\nenemies: I despise every sort of uncleanliness in concepts and valuations in\nthem, every kind of cowardice in the face of every honest yea or nay. For\nalmost one thousand years, now, they have tangled and confused everything they\nhave laid their hands on; they have on their conscience all the half-measures,\nall the three-eighth measures of which Europe is sick; they also have the most\nunclean, the most incurable, and the most irrefutable kind of\nChristianity\u2014Protestantism\u2014on their conscience.... If we shall never be able\nto get rid of Christianity, the _Germans_ will be to blame.\n\n62\n\n\u2014With this I will now conclude and pronounce my judgment. I _condemn_\nChristianity and confront it with the most terrible accusation that an accuser\nhas ever had in his mouth. To my mind it is the greatest of all conceivable\ncorruptions, it has had the will to the last imaginable corruption. The\nChristian Church allowed nothing to escape from its corruption; it converted\nevery value into its opposite, every truth into a He, and every honest impulse\ninto an ignominy of the soul. Let anyone dare to speak to me of its\nhumanitarian blessings! To _abolish_ any sort of distress was opposed to its\nprofoundest interests; its very existence depended on states of distress; it\ncreated states of distress in order to make itself immortal.... The cancer\ngerm of sin, for instance: the Church was the first to enrich mankind with\nthis misery!\u2014The \u201cequality of souls before God,\u201d this falsehood, this\n_pretext_ for the _rancunes_ of all the base-minded, this anarchist bomb of a\nconcept, which has ultimately become the revolution, the modern idea, the\nprinciple of decay of the whole of social order,\u2014this is _Christian_ dynamite\n... The \u201chumanitarian\u201d blessings of Christianity! To breed a self-\ncontradiction, an art of self-profanation, a will to lie at any price, an\naversion, a contempt of all good and honest instincts out of _humanitas!_ Is\nthis what you call the blessings of Christianity?\u2014Parasitism as the only\nmethod of the Church; sucking all the blood, all the love, all the hope of\nlife out of mankind with an\u00e6mic and sacred ideals.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 359967, "end_char_idx": 363444, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "28b865f8-740e-42e3-8352-91f9c2af943d": {"__data__": {"id_": "28b865f8-740e-42e3-8352-91f9c2af943d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "52ce8356-28ca-4fd0-8eb5-1ff3aabc8a3b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ccacc582c0a976ac41dcb5ef4cb24995eba34bf63d001bc0cdd72802091e1e89", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a735a36a-01ea-4be0-8c48-c2dc1a10ce30", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "d0bd429cb01093723dc6e9f19d5f408e828ad970e81205de5174b47ecc9f3f26", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c1b1ca65-61b7-4f4a-b5b3-41b7c98252a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b14b03262c763f755a1956afce830eee4e35c5f98c45ea3686c6c092802e63cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "To breed a self-\ncontradiction, an art of self-profanation, a will to lie at any price, an\naversion, a contempt of all good and honest instincts out of _humanitas!_ Is\nthis what you call the blessings of Christianity?\u2014Parasitism as the only\nmethod of the Church; sucking all the blood, all the love, all the hope of\nlife out of mankind with an\u00e6mic and sacred ideals.

This being so, they must have been composed\ntowards the autumn of the year 1881.\n\nI have already pointed out elsewhere (_Will to Power,_ vol. ii., Translator\u2019s\nPreface) how much importance Nietzsche himself ascribed to this doctrine, and\nhow, until the end, he regarded it as the inspiration which had led to his\nchief work, _Thus Spake Zarathustra._ For the details relating to its\ninception, however, I would refer the reader to Mrs Foerster-Nietzsche\u2019s\nIntroduction to her brother\u2019s chief work, which was translated for the\neleventh volume of this Edition of the Complete Works.\n\nIn reading these notes it would be well to refer to Nietzsche\u2019s other\nutterances on the subject which are to be found at the end of vol. ii. of the\n_Will to Power,_ and also, if possible, to have recourse to the original\nGerman text. Despite the greatest care, I confess that in some instances, I\nhave felt a little doubt as to the precise English equivalent for the thoughts\nexpressed under the heading _Eternal Recurrence;_ and, though I have\nattributed this difficulty to the extreme novelty of the manner in which the\nsubject is presented, it is well that the reader should be aware that such\ndoubt has been entertained. For I disbelieve utterly in mere verbal\ntranslation, however accurate, and would question anybody\u2019s right to convert a\nGerman sentence into English\u2014even though he were so perfect in both languages\nas to be almost absolutely bilingual,\u2014if he did not completely grasp the\nthought behind the sentence.\n\nThe writing of the collected Explanatory Notes to _Thus Spake Zarathustra_ ,\ncannot be given any exact date. Some of them consist of comments, written down\nby Nietzsche after the completion of the book, and kept as the nucleus of an\nactual commentary to Zarathustra, which it seems to have been his intention,\none day, to write; while others are merely memoranda and rough sketches,\nprobably written before the completion of the work, and which served the\npurpose of a draft of his original plan.

LUDOVICI.\n\n* * *\n\n#### I. ETERNAL RECURRENCE\n\n##### 1\\. THE DOCTRINE EXPOUNDED AND SUBSTANTIATED.\n\n1.\n\nThe extent of universal energy is limited; it is not \u201cinfinite\u201d: we should\nbeware of such excesses in our concepts! Consequently the number of states,\nchanges, combinations, and evolutions of this energy, although it may be\nenormous and practically incalculable, is at any rate definite and not\nunlimited. The time, however, in which this universal energy works its changes\nis infinite\u2014that is to say, energy remains eternally the same and is eternally\nactive:\u2014at this moment an infinity has already elapsed, that is to say, every\npossible evolution must already have taken place. Consequently the present\nprocess of evolution must be a repetition, as was also the one before it, as\nwill also be the one which will follow. And so on forwards and backwards!\nInasmuch as the entire state of all forces continually returns, everything has\nexisted an infinite number of times. Whether, apart from this, anything\nexactly like something that formerly existed has ever appeared, is completely\nbeyond proof. It would seem that each complete state of energy forms all\nqualities afresh even to the smallest degree, so that two different complete\nstates could have nothing in common. Is it to be supposed that in one and the\nsame complete states two precisely similar things could appear\u2014for instance\ntwo leaves? I doubt it: it would take for granted that they had both had an\nabsolutely similar origin, and in that case we should have to assume that\nright back in infinity two similar things had also existed despite all the\nchanges in the complete states and their creation of new qualities\u2014an\nimpossible assumption.\n\n2\n\nFormerly it was thought that unlimited energy was a necessary corollary to\nunlimited activity in time, and that this energy could be exhausted by no form\nof consumption. Now it is thought that energy remains constant and docs not\nrequire to be infinite. It is eternally active but it is no longer able\neternally to create new forms, it must repeat itself: that is my conclusion.\n\n3\n\nAn incalculable number of complete states of energy have existed, but these\nhave not been infinitely different: for if they had been, unlimited energy\nwould have been necessary. The energy of the universe can only have a given\nnumber of possible qualities.\n\n4\n\nThe endless evolution of new forms is a contradiction, for it would imply\neternally increasing energy.

We are therefore\nforced to conclude: (1) either that the universe began its activity at a given\nmoment of time and will end in a similar fashion,\u2014but the beginning of\nactivity is absurd; if a state of equilibrium had been reached it would have\npersisted to all eternity; (2) Or there is no such thing as an endless number\nof changes, but a circle consisting of a definite number of them which\ncontinually recurs: activity is eternal, the number of the products and states\nof energy is limited.\n\n7\n\nIf all the possible combinations and relations of forces had not already been\nexhausted, then an infinity would not yet lie behind us. Now since infinite\ntime must be assumed, no fresh possibility can exist and everything must have\nappeared already, and moreover an infinite number of times.\n\n8\n\nThe present world of forces leads back to a state of greatest simplicity in\nthese forces: it likewise leads forwards to such a state,\u2014cannot and must not\n_both_ states be identical? No incalculable number of states can evolve out of\na system of limited forces, that is to say, out of a given quantity of energy\nwhich may be precisely measured. Only when we falsely assume that space is\nunlimited, and that therefore energy gradually becomes dissipated, can the\nfinal state be an unproductive and lifeless one.\n\n9\n\nFirst principles.\u2014The last physical state of energy which we can imagine must\nnecessarily be the first also. The absorption of energy in latent energy must\nbe the cause of the production of the most vital energy. For a highly positive\nstate must follow a negative state Space like matter is a subjective form,\ntime is not. The notion of space first arose from the assumption that space\ncould be empty. But there is no such thing as empty space. Everything is\nenergy.\n\nWe cannot think of that which moves and that which is moved together, but both\nthese things constitute matter and space. We isolate.\n\n10\n\nConcerning the resurrection of the world.\u2014Out of two negatives, when they are\nforces, a positive arises. (Darkness comes of light opposed to light, cold\narises from warmth opposed to warmth, &c., &c.)\n\n11\n\nAn uncertain state of equilibrium occurs just as seldom in nature as two\nabsolutely equal triangles. Consequently anything like a static state of\nenergy in general is impossible. If stability were possible it would already\nhave been reached.\n\n12\n\nEither complete equilibrium must in itself be an impossibility, or the changes\nof energy introduce themselves in the circular process before that equilibrium\nwhich is in itself possible has appeared.\u2014But it would be madness to ascribe a\nfeeling of self-preservation to existence!

If we assume that there has ever been a\nstate absolutely like the present one this assumption is in no wise refuted by\nthe present state. For, among all the endless possibilities, this case must\nalready have occurred, as an infinity is already behind us. If equilibrium\nwere possible it would already have been reached.\u2014And if this momentary state\nhas already existed then that which bore it and the previous one also would\nlikewise have existed and so on backwards,\u2014and from this it follows that it\nhas already existed not only twice but three times,\u2014just as it will exist\nagain not only twice but three times,\u2014in fact an infinite number of times\nbackwards and forwards. That is to say, the whole process of Becoming consists\nof a repetition of a definite number of precisely similar states.\u2014Clearly the\nhuman brain cannot be left to imagine the whole series of possibilities: but\nin any case, quite apart from our ability to judge or our inability to\nconceive the whole range of possibilities, the present state at least is a\npossible one\u2014because it is a real one. We should therefore say: in the event\nof the number of possibilities not being infinite, and assuming that in the\ncourse of unlimited time a limited number of these must appear, all real\nstates must have been preceded by similar states? Because from every given\nmoment a whole infinity is to be calculated backwards? The stability of forces\nand their equilibrium is a possible alternative: but it has not been reached;\nconsequently the number of possibilities is greater than the number of real\nstates. The fact that nothing similar recurs could not be explained by\nappealing to accident, but only by supposing that a certain intention, that no\nsimilar things should recur, were actually inherent in the essence of energy:\nfor, if we grant that the number of cases is enormous, the occurrence of like\ncases is more probable than absolute disparity.\n\n15\n\nLet us think backwards a moment If the world had a goal, this goal must have\nbeen reached: if a certain (unintentional) final state existed for the world,\nthis state also would have been reached. If it were in any way capable of a\nstationary or stable condition, and if in the whole course of its existence\nonly one second of Being, in the strict sense of the word, had been possible,\nthen there could no longer be such a process as evolution, and therefore no\nthinking and no observing of such a process. If on the other hand the world\nwere something which continually renovated itself, it would then be understood\nto be something miraculous and free to create itself\u2014in fact something divine.\nEternal renovation presupposes that energy voluntarily increases itself, that\nit not only has the intention, but also the power, to avoid repeating itself\nor to avoid returning into a previous form, and that every instant it adjusts\nitself in every one of its movements to prevent such a contingency,\u2014or that it\nwas incapable of returning to a state it had already passed through. That\nwould mean that the whole sum of energy was not constant, any more than its\nattributes were But a sum of energy which would be inconstant and which would\nfluctuate is quite unthinkable Let us not indulge our fancy any longer with\nunthinkable things in order to fall once more before the concept of a Creator\n(multiplication out of nothing, reduction out of nothing, absolute\narbitrariness and freedom in growth and in qualities):\u2014\n\n16\n\nHe who does not believe in the circular process of the universe must pin his\nfaith to an arbitrary God\u2014thus my doctrine becomes necessary as opposed to all\nthat has been said hitherto in matters of Theism.\n\n17\n\nThe hypothesis which I would oppose to that of the eternal circular\nprocess:\u2014Would it be just as possible to explain the laws of the mechanical\nworld as exceptions and seemingly as accidents among the things of the\nuniverse, as one possibility only among an incalculable number of\npossibilities?", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 375672, "end_char_idx": 380240, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a951cc43-e5ee-4be0-9b96-e397f78650cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "a951cc43-e5ee-4be0-9b96-e397f78650cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "52ce8356-28ca-4fd0-8eb5-1ff3aabc8a3b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ccacc582c0a976ac41dcb5ef4cb24995eba34bf63d001bc0cdd72802091e1e89", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "519be565-3d50-4344-b54e-f1d045bc994f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "24add35d54263e611f888a1fdb817df0d54f5309b402c259a0f7e14d954f7ad6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d6c497d5-0189-47af-8380-cc9f4ce12c7c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "92174daa47866233f14b04d4f2fb2b0e892bbfa26886559c90a76b5761fd5f67", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "17\n\nThe hypothesis which I would oppose to that of the eternal circular\nprocess:\u2014Would it be just as possible to explain the laws of the mechanical\nworld as exceptions and seemingly as accidents among the things of the\nuniverse, as one possibility only among an incalculable number of\npossibilities?

All that is anthropomorphism! Anarchy, ugliness, form\u2014are\nunrelated concepts. There is no such thing as imperfection in the realm of\nmechanics.\n\nEverything has returned: Sirius, and the spider, and thy thoughts at this\nmoment, and this last thought of thine that all these things will return.\n\n23\n\nOur whole world consists of the ashes of an incalculable number of living\ncreatures: and even if living matter is ever so little compared with the\nwhole, everything has already been transformed into life once before and thus\nthe process goes on. If we grant eternal time we must assume the eternal\nchange of matter.\n\n24\n\nWhoever thou mayest be, beloved stranger, whom I meet here for the first time,\navail thyself of this happy hour and of the stillness around us, and above us,\nand let me tell thee something of the thought which has suddenly risen before\nme like a star which would fain shed down its rays upon thee and every one, as\nbefits the nature of light\u2014\n\n25\n\nThe world of energy suffers no diminution: otherwise with eternal time it\nwould have grown weak and finally have perished altogether.

Your whole life,\nlike a sandglass, will always be reversed and will ever run out again,\u2014a long\nminute of time will elapse until all those conditions out of which you were\nevolved return in the wheel of the cosmic process. And then you will find\nevery pain and every pleasure, every friend and every enemy, every hope and\nevery error, every blade of grass and every ray of sunshine once more, and the\nwhole fabric of things that makes up your life. This ring in which you are but\na grain will glitter afresh for ever. And in every one of these cycles of\nhuman life there will be one hour where for the first time one man, and then\nmany, will perceive the mighty thought of the eternal recurrence of all\nthings:\u2014and for mankind this is always the hour of Noon.\n\n##### 2\\. THE EFFECTS OF THE DOCTRINE UPON MANKIND\n\n26\n\nHow can we give weight to our inner life without making it evil and fanatical\ntowards people who think otherwise. Religious belief is declining and man is\nbeginning to regard himself as ephemeral and unessential, a point of view\nwhich is making him weak; he does not exercise so much effort in striving or\nenduring. What he wants is momentary enjoyment He would make things light for\nhimself,\u2014and a good deal of his spirit gets squandered in this endeavour.\n\n27\n\nThe political mania at which I smile just as merrily as my contemporaries\nsmile at the religious mania of former times is above all Materialism, a\nbelief in the world, and in the repudiation of a \u201cBeyond,\u201d of a \u201cback-world.\u201d\nThe object of those who believe in the latter is the well-being of the\nephemeral individual: that is why Socialism is its fruit; for with Socialism\nephemeral individuals wish to secure their happiness by means of\nsocialisation. They have no reason to wait, as those men had who believed in\neternal souls, in eternal development and eternal amelioration. My doctrine\nis: Live so that thou mayest desire to live again,\u2014that is thy duty,\u2014for in\nany case thou wilt live again He unto whom striving is the greatest happiness,\nlet him strive; he unto whom peace is the greatest happiness, let him rest; he\nunto whom subordination, following, obedience, is the greatest happiness, let\nhim obey. All that is necessary is that he should know what it is that gives\nhim the highest happiness, and to fight shy of no means! Eternity is at stake!\n\n28\n\n\u201cBut if everything is necessary, what control have I over my actions?\u201d Thought\nand faith are a form of ballast which burden thee in addition to other burdens\nthou mayest have, and which are even more weighty than the latter. Sayest thou\nthat nutrition, the land of thy birth, air, and society change thee and\ndetermine thee? Well, thy opinions do this to a much greater degree, for they\neven prescribe thy nourishment, thy land of adoption, thy atmosphere, and thy\nsociety for thee.\u2014If thou ever assimilatest the thought of thoughts it will\nalso alter thee.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 387217, "end_char_idx": 391441, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4240eeca-9609-4c5d-b83b-81e5650ccbfb": {"__data__": {"id_": "4240eeca-9609-4c5d-b83b-81e5650ccbfb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "52ce8356-28ca-4fd0-8eb5-1ff3aabc8a3b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ccacc582c0a976ac41dcb5ef4cb24995eba34bf63d001bc0cdd72802091e1e89", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b1e28a0d-cb42-4a9c-ad4b-1442413c9a7a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "b07d8ab25a41ba80b63ee27a194ab6dff1491bf462442572ce483205375a8bb6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d13a0a57-41bd-482b-b770-937962c3edae", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "78f6903602c431333c069ae3b6b6b036e741cb03135a55760e845cce85fda0d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "All that is necessary is that he should know what it is that gives\nhim the highest happiness, and to fight shy of no means!

But it is precisely in this respect that there lies some possibility\nof determining new emotions and new desires in men.\n\n30\n\nLet us try and discover how the thought that something gets repeated has\naffected mankind hitherto (the year, for instance, or periodical illnesses,\nwaking and sleeping, &). Even supposing the recurrence of the cycle is only a\nprobability or a possibility, even a thought, even a possibility, can shatter\nus and transform us. It is not only feelings and definite expectations that do\nthis! See what effect the thought of eternal damnation has had!\n\n31\n\nFrom the moment when this thought begins to prevail all colours will change\ntheir hue and a new history will begin.\n\n32\n\nThe history of the future: this thought will tend to triumph ever more and\nmore, and those who disbelieve in it will be forced, according to their\nnature, ultimately to die out.\n\nHe, alone, who will regard his existence as capable of eternal recurrence will\nremain over: but among such as these a state will be possible of which the\nimagination of no utopist has ever dreamt!\n\n33\n\nYe fancy that ye will have a long rest ere your second birth takes place,\u2014but\ndo not deceive yourselves! \u2019Twixt your last moment of consciousness and the\nfirst ray of the dawn of your new life no time will elapse,\u2014as a flash of\nlightning will the space go by, even though living creatures think it is\nbillions of years, and are not even able to reckon it. Timelessness and\nimmediate re-birth are compatible, once intellect is eliminated!\n\n34\n\nThou feelest that thou must soon take thy leave perhaps\u2014and the sunset glow of\nthis feeling pierces through thy happiness. Give heed to this sign: it means\nthat thou lovest life and thyself, and life as it has hitherto affected thee\nand moulded thee,\u2014and that thou cravest for its eternity\u2014 _Non alia sed hac\nvita sempiterna!_\n\nKnow also, that transiency singeth its short song for ever afresh and that at\nthe sound of the first verse thou wilt almost die of longing when thou\nthinkest that it might be for the last time.\n\n35\n\nLet us stamp the impress of eternity upon our lives!

Blessed moments I And\nthen we must once again pull down the curtain and turn our thoughts to the\nnext unswerving purpose.\n\n43\n\nMankind must set its goal above itself\u2014not in a false world, however, but in\none which would be a continuation of humanity.\n\n44\n\nThe half-way house is always present when the will to the future arises: the\ngreatest event stands immediately before it.\n\n45\n\nOur very essence is to create a being higher than ourselves. We must create\nbeyond ourselves. That is the instinct of procreation, that is the instinct of\naction and of work.\u2014Just as all willing presupposes a purpose, so does mankind\npresuppose a creature which is not yet formed but which provides the aim of\nlife. This is the freedom of all will. Love, reverence, yearning for\nperfection, longing, all these things are inherent in a purpose.\n\n46\n\nMy desire: to bring forth creatures which stand sublimely above the whole\nspecies man: and to sacrifice \u201cone\u2019s neighbours\u201d and oneself to this end.\n\nThe morality which has existed hitherto was limited within the confines of the\nspecies: all moralities that have existed hitherto have been useful in the\nfirst place in order to give unconditional stability to this species: once\nthis has been achieved the aim can be elevated.\n\nOne movement is absolute; it is nothing more than the levelling down of\nmankind, great ant-organisations, &c.\n\nThe other movement, my movement, is conversely the accentuation of all\ncontrasts and gulfs, and the elimination of equality, together with the\ncreation of supremely powerful creatures.\n\nThe first movement brings forth the last man, my movement brings forth the\nSuperman. It is by no means the goal to regard the latter as the master of the\nfirst: two races ought to exist side by side,\u2014separated as far asunder as\npossible; the one, like the Epicurean gods, not concerning themselves in the\nleast with the others.\n\n47\n\nThe opposite of the Superman is the last man: I created him simultaneously\nwith the former.\n\n48\n\nThe more an individual is free and firm, the more exacting becomes his love:\nat last he yearns for Superman, because nothing else is able to appease his\nlove,\n\n49\n\nHalf-way round the course Superman arises.\n\n50\n\nAmong men I was frightened: among men I desired a host of things and nothing\nsatisfied me. It was then that I went into solitude and created Superman. And\nwhen I had created him I draped him in the great veil of Becoming and let the\nlight of midday shine upon him.\n\n51\n\n\u201cWe wish to create a Being,\u201d we all wish to have a hand in it, to love it.

He lays his hands on the next thousand years.\n\nHis love increases as he sees the impossibility of avoiding the affliction of\npain with it.\n\n76\n\nZarathustra\u2019s mood is not one of mad impatience for Superman! It is peaceful,\nit can wait: but all action has derived some purpose from being the road and\nmeans thither,\u2014and must be done well and perfectly.\n\nThe repose of the great stream! Consecration of the smallest thing. All\nunrest, and violent longing, all loathing should be presented in the third\npart and be overcome! The gentleness, and mildness, &c., in the first and\nsecond parts are both signs of a power which is not yet self-reliant!\n\nWith the recovery of Zarathustra, C\u00e6sar stands there inexorable and kind:\u2014the\ngulf separating creation, goodness, and wisdom is annihilated.\n\nClearness, peace, no exaggerated craving, happiness in the moment which is\nproperly occupied and immortalised!\n\n77\n\nZarathustra, Part III.: \u201cI myself am happy.\u201d\u2014When he had taken leave of\nmankind he returned unto himself. Like a cloud it vanishes from him. The\nmanner in which Superman must live: like an Epicurean God.\n\nDivine suffering is the substance of the third part of Zarathustra. The human\nstate of the legislator is only brought forward as an example.\n\nHis intense love for his friends seems to him a disease,\u2014once more he becomes\npeaceful.\n\nWhen the invitations come he gently evades them.\n\n78\n\nIn the fourth part it is necessary to say precisely why it is that the time of\nthe great noon has come: It is really a description of the age given by means\nof visits, but interpreted by Zarathustra.\n\nIn the fourth part it is necessary to say precisely why \u201ca chosen people\u201d has\nfirst to be created:\u2014they are the lucky cases of nature as opposed to the\nunlucky (exemplified by the visitors): only to them \u2014the lucky cases\u2014is\nZarathustra able to express himself concerning ultimate problems, them alone\nis he able to inspire with activity on behalf of this theory. They are strong,\nhealthy, hard and above all noble enough for him to give them the hammer with\nwhich to remould the whole world.\n\n79\n\nThe unity in power of the creator, the lover and the knight of knowledge.\n\n80\n\nLove alone shall judge\u2014(the creative love which forgets itself in its work).\n\n81\n\nZarathustra can only dispense happiness once the order of rank is established.\nTherefore this doctrine must be taught first.\n\nThe order of rank develops into a system of earthly dominion: the lords of the\nearth come last, a new ruling caste. Here and there there arises from them a\nperfectly Epicurean God, a Superman, a transfigurer of existence.\n\nThe Superhuman\u2019s notion of the world. Dionysus. Returning from these most\nstrange of all pursuits Zarathustra comes back with love to the narrowest and\nsmallest things,\u2014he blesses all his experiences and dies with a blessing on\nhis lips.\n\n82\n\nFrom people who merely pray we must become people who bless.\n\n\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS; OR, HOW TO\nPHILOSOPHIZE WITH THE HAMMER.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 420941, "end_char_idx": 424980, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae949c80-bc6a-40b8-9487-fb8464ea9da5": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae949c80-bc6a-40b8-9487-fb8464ea9da5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "52ce8356-28ca-4fd0-8eb5-1ff3aabc8a3b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "ccacc582c0a976ac41dcb5ef4cb24995eba34bf63d001bc0cdd72802091e1e89", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "54be6c52-b6e9-4c67-a575-a0462e0a09c7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/gh40/Documents/llama_index_project/books/twilight/twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_name": "twilight_of_the_idols.epub", "file_type": "application/epub+zip", "file_size": 234574, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "87029b5167364225e4abc3569ee1120be40fb1794c29874b9be03763f9d0d85c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1272947c-924b-483f-89f0-0f9cbdc4b51b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f22b8d3ec6126ddb80d8a820912be6e867d4b6a4b6760e5e02fff347ea72fdaf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS; OR, HOW TO\nPHILOSOPHIZE WITH THE HAMMER.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public\nsupport and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of\npublic domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-\nreadable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated\nequipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to\nmaintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities\nand charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance\nrequirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much\npaperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not\nsolicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation\nof compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit\n[www.gutenberg.org/donate](https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/).\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not\nmet the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting\nunsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers\nto donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the\nUnited States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and\naddresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks,\nonline payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit:\nwww.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg\u2122 concept\nof a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For\nforty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a\nloose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all\nof which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a\ncopyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in\ncompliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search facility:\n[www.gutenberg.org](https://www.gutenberg.org).\n\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122, including how to\nmake donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to\nhelp produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to\nhear about new eBooks.\n\n\n![Cover](7241903898164660184_cover.png)", "mimetype":
